1,"Einstein once theorized that to travel back in time one would have to move faster than the speed of light which, according to the laws of physics, is impossible. There are hypothetical particles known as tachyons which are said to travel so fast that they travel back in time. Even though tachyons have never been proven to exist, I can’t help but wonder if maybe sometimes our minds are like tachyons, when our thoughts travel so fast that we find ourselves stuck in the past for a short while, sometimes longer.
 It’s very easy to reminisce, maybe a song comes on and our minds start remembering moments in our past that are associated with that song. For example, maybe the song was yours and your then-partners favorite song, which you would both sing along to whenever it played. Or maybe the song reminds you of a time when you felt lost and suddenly you start questioning your life and wonder how far you’ve come since then. Sometimes it may feel like even though its months, or even years, later you’re still in the same place, but you’re not. Yes you may still feel lost but don’t forget how long you’ve survived and all the things you’ve accomplished (not matter how few, or how small) while feeling lost and never give up hope that one day you won’t feel that way anymore. One day you will hear that same song and smile at the times you felt lost because you’ll finally be exactly where you wanted to be, where you were always meant to be.
Of course, it is always easy to talk about hope and all the “one days” that we tell ourselves, but in the moment it’s very difficult to believe. The most we can do, is just feel the pain. In his book The fault in our stars John Green wrote “that’s the thing about pain, it demands to be felt” Think about how your muscles grow when you gym. When you’re on your last rep, it hurts so much that the pain seems unbearable, just this last one you tell yourself as you suffer through the pain and over time, your muscles begin to grow, you begin to become stronger than you were before. In other words, in order to grow, our muscles have to break first. It is the same with emotional pain, first we break and then we become stronger. You have to constantly remind yourself that nothing lasts forever; not pain, not even happiness. There is a story about a king who asked his wise men to invent a sentence which, in times of difficulty, would give him hope and, in times of joy, would remind him to be humble. After some time they presented him with a ring, and inscribed on this ring were the words “this too shall pass”. 
The definition of a soulmate is given by a person regarded as ones destined life partner. I often find myself wondering if I have already met, and lost, her. If you have ever been in a serious relationship I’m sure you have thought, at least once, that they were your soulmate. I have only been in two serious relationships and at some point they both felt like “the one”. This contradicts the very concept as the phrase itself implies there can be only one. One person who makes you feel unlike anyone else. One person who you love more than anything in the world. One person you are meant to be with. But maybe sometimes, we can have more than one soulmate. This could just be the view of someone who hasn’t yet met his soulmate, or maybe it’s the view of someone who had two soulmates, and lost them both.
As a data scientist, it is my job to extract facts from data that aren’t apparent naturally. For example, trying to identify data that stands out from the rest; an anomaly. Trying to identify an anomaly in a bunch of raw data is almost impossible, but once you perform deeper analysis it becomes clearer which data are anomalies. I like to think of soulmates like this. If we consider all the people we’ll ever meet as data, then our soulmates would be the anomalies. Of course, when you meet someone new there is no way of knowing whether they are your soulmate or not until you perform deeper analysis. In the process of getting to know someone we are gathering data about them, and eventually we will know if they are like all the other people in our lives or if they’re anomalous, and could be our soulmates. 
My first love was the first anomaly in my life. We had known each other as kids but when our families stopped being friends we fell out of each other’s lives, the first fallout of many to come, but at the time no one could have known that. A few years later we reconnected on Facebook. After that, for about four years, we didn’t see each other but spoke almost every single day on Facebook, BBM or WhatsApp. We became best friends. The reason she was the first anomaly is that I had never experienced a connection like that before. I have always been the type of person who lives in his head and because of this I always find it very difficult to trust and open up to people, but I became so close to her that I opened myself up in ways I had never before. When we started dating it felt like all the pieces of the puzzle that was our messy friendship were finally falling into place. The age gap between us was only two years but the gap in our lives was a lot bigger. I was already in university and she was in her final years of school. This meant that we only saw each other on weekends which, at the time, seemed like a trial but after being in a relationship where I saw my partner every single day, I realise that maybe it was a blessing in disguise. The gap between us came with other, more serious, complications too; our expectations of the relationship were very different. I think this was our biggest problem and perhaps what lead to us breaking up. I don’t regret our relationship but I do regret some aspects of who I became; jealous and insecure, feelings I had never experienced before. Even though I don’t regret our relationship, I wish we hadn’t dated when we did. I saw a quote recently that read I think we were meant to be, but we did it wrong and, to me, this is something that applies to us. I remember we promised each other that we’d try again and yet now, two years later, she has moved on. And this is okay, I guess, because people always make promises they can’t keep. I can’t help but wonder if she still thinks about me, if maybe there’s a small part of her that still feels the same, if maybe she’d be willing to try again, but these are questions I may never get an answer to. For the most part, I just miss the type of relationship we had and what hurts the most is knowing that I won’t find something like that with anyone else.
My second love was the second anomaly. What makes anomalies in data so interesting, and difficult to find, is that no two anomalies are the same. Another way of thinking of this is that we never fall in love the same way twice. The type of relationship we had was very different to my first. We didn’t have four years of friendship as our foundation, yet the relationship felt just as right as the first, maybe even more so. After my first relationship ended I was so sure that I would never feel anything close to that again, but then I met her. It felt as though she hit the reset button on the world. The way we met may have seemed like a coincidence but I don’t believe in coincidences, I believe in destiny. And for a long time I was convinced that she was my destiny. One of the big differences between this relationship and the first was that we saw each other a lot more, because we were in the same university. At the time I thought was a blessing but it may just have been what lead to our downfall. The closer you get to someone, the more space you leave for jealousy and insecurity and in the end, this was what tore us apart. When a relationship ends it is very easy to point fingers and shift the blame away from yourself, but I have no trouble admitting that I also played a part in our end. It has been a few months since we broke up but it still gets to me; I still have flashbacks of times we were together, and whether the flashbacks are of good or bad memories, it hurts the same. The hardest part is that I still miss her as though we just broke up yesterday. I don’t think I’ll ever stop missing her because I dedicated such a big part of myself to the relationship, to her, a part of myself that I’ll never get back. Because of the way we broke up, a lot of people seem to think that only she is to blame and one way I know I still love her is that I always get protective over her in those situations. Because I know that I am just as much to blame as she is, and just because we ended badly, it doesn’t make either of us bad people. I wish I could just hate her, which would make moving on a lot easier.
I believe that love, true love, is infinite and because of this we can’t compare one love to another. They say that all good things come to an end and using that logic I have come to the conclusion that the most beautiful things have the most beautiful endings. Beautiful in the sense that the chaos it results in is beautiful. In the move The lion king 2 Simba talks about how fires destroy everything in their path but what comes after is growth. I think it like this with breakups; they can be so messy and cause a lot of pain but what comes after this is growth which can either be something beautiful or something dark. Considering that even though the two relationships I have been in were very different from one another but still both ended, I have become very despondent towards relationships. I am no longer the once wide-eyed hopeless romantic I always was, I no longer believe in soulmates or, at least, I no longer believe that I have (another) soulmate. I am starting to believe that one day I will just have to settle for somebody so that I don’t end up dying alone. Before you call my cynical or depressed or anything, I want you to ask yourself something; how many relationships have you been in, that you thought would last forever, which had a happy ending?

2,"As someone who has always had an interest in Astronomy, I have always found black holes to be interesting. In fact, I like to imagine that if one day I fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming an Astronomer, my area of research would either be cosmology, black holes or dark matter. In layman’s terms, black holes are objects in space which have such a strong force of gravity that nothing can escape them, not even light. This means that as soon as anything approaches a black holes event horizon (the area around the black hole where its gravitational pull begins to affect objects) it gets sucked in. When a stars fuel is used up and the energy flow from its core stops, it dies. During the death of a star, some nuclear reactions outside the core cause the dying star to expand outward (known as the ‘red giant’ phase) until it inevitably collapses in on itself. If the mass of the star is relatively low, it will form a White Dwarf. If the mass is large, the dying star may form a Neutron Star. If the mass of the star is very large, however, it collapses in on itself to form a black hole. Because the gravitational pull of black hole is so strong, they may literally devour other objects in space, like stars or planets.
When an object, for example a star, gets close to black hole, the gravitational pull on the star is a lot stronger on the side closer to the black hole, so gravity stretches it and pulls it apart. The best way to imagine this is that the black hole would literally glow around its event horizon, as the star is stretched and pulled apart. In his 2014 movie Interstellar, Christopher Nolan provided viewers with an idea of what this would look like visually. On April 10th 2019, scientists managed to capture the first ever image of a black hole. This took the collaboration of many different experts. The image confirmed that previous artistic depictions of black holes, including Christopher Nolan’s, were accurate. One of the things I have always wondered about is what would happen if a person fell into a black hole. Similar to a star, the person would be stretched and pulled apart across the event horizon, known as spaghettification. Some scientists even joke that the person would be able to the back of his/her own head during this process, if they didn’t die yet. Some people even theorize that black holes are portals to other dimensions. However, the thing we can all agree on is that if someone were to fall into a black hole, they would lose themselves. Sometimes, I think that I’m like a black hole, because it feels like when people get close to my event horizon they get pulled in, and lose themselves.
Let me start off by saying that I don’t think I’m a bad person, per se. Generally, I don’t think that most people are exclusively good or bad, especially not in relationships. Everyone has some toxic traits, some of which are more noticeable than others. For example, some people may be physically/emotionally abusive. Some people have commitment issues. Some people have trust issues. The problem with dating is that not everyone is aware of their toxic traits and we therefore go around with all these unresolved issues jumping from one relationship to the next, spreading hurt like an epidemic. Even though I haven’t been in many relationships, I figured out my toxic traits early on. Jealousy, insecurity and possessiveness just to name a few. A close friend recently asked me why I get jealous and insecure. I smiled, because I have asked myself this exact question many times before. I don’t think that I’m a very intelligent person, but I feel as though I have a pretty solid understanding of the world around me and a decent, albeit amateur, understanding of the cosmos above. Despite this, I struggle a lot when it comes to understanding the universe that exists inside me, this lack of understanding of my internal existence is perhaps one of my biggest weaknesses.
Even though I still don’t understand why, I have spent a lot of time working on myself (as people say) trying to let go of these toxic traits. For the most part, I think I’ve gotten a lot better over the years. But I don’t think it will ever be truly gone until I begin to understand exactly why it’s there in the first place. The dangerous thing about these traits is that they’re not always explicit. For example, if I’m beginning a new relationship with someone, the jealousy may first come across as cute. I think that what also draws people in is the fact that when I love, I love hard, one might even say I over-love. And so these traits may come across as simply part of all the love I give, as minor red flags. But I have literally watched these traits infect people I love and saw the effects it has had not only my relationships but the people I’m in them with. It changes them, even if they won’t admit it themselves. I wouldn’t say that they become unhappy really, just different. They don’t smile the same, they don’t laugh the same and it’s really hard to think that someone you love has changed so much and you’re the reason why.
Although the general idea is that nothing can escape a black hole, Prof. Stephen Hawking once said that things can get out of a black hole, so no matter how hopeless you feel about your current situation, you should hold onto the belief that things will get better. This holds true for people who manage to escape me. Despite the hurt I caused by leaving, I have literally seen her flourish once I was out of her life, more than once. And although she may be a bit different, and things may not be perfect in her life, she definitely seems to be doing better without me around. This may sound like a depressing point of view, but Stephen Chbosky once wrote that if you care about somebody you should want them to be happy, even if you wind up being left out. How do you look at the love of your life and tell yourself it’s time to walk away? I don’t know which is harder – choosing to walk away because you feel you’re not good for them, or having to stay away because they don’t seem to have place for you in their lives anymore. I haven’t quite figured out that part yet, but until then I’ll keep popping pills and smoking trying to numb the pain that I know will never go away. As I try to move forward, I will try to find some solace in the words of Kid Cudi when he said All along, I knew I was meant to be alone, out there out on my own.

3,"To feel sad, repentant, or disappointed over something that one has done or failed to do, this is the definition of regret. There is a famous quote that says we only regret the things we didn’t do and although this may be true, I can’t help but think that sometimes we regret the things we did more than the things we didn’t do. Albert Einstein once theorized that to travel back in time one would have to travel faster than the speed of light. And although this is impossible, currently at least, I can’t help but wish that I could turn back time and correct what may just be the biggest mistake I’ll ever make. But unfortunately life doesn’t work like typing out a story, when we make a mistake we can’t simply backspace and rewind the clocks, we have to try and learn from our mistakes and try to do better in the future. Like most things in life, this is something that’s easier said than done and I am still trying to live with my biggest regret; letting you, again.
As you may know, I’m not really good at expressing my thoughts and feelings except through writing. Because when I write, it’s as though my soul is bleeding onto the pages as the words I could never say flow through my fingers. I guess that’s why I decided to write this. Because bottling up everything is killing me, slowly, and I hope that this will help, even if just a little.
Firstly, I want to start off by apologizing. I know that simply saying “I’m sorry” doesn’t do anything to take away the pain I caused, but I remember this one quote I saw years ago that read Sorry is nothing, the real apology is when you can look in their eyes and see they’ve hurt themselves just as much. And believe me, if you had looked in my eyes at any point in the last 5 months, you would have seen just how much my actions hurt me, even if not as much as it hurt you. I have been putting myself in your shoes, and tried to imagine what it must have been like for you, to try and imagine what it must have felt like to have someone who claimed to love you so much, hurt you so badly, but whenever I do, it breaks me and I can’t help but feel like such a terrible person. There was a time where I was convinced that I was a bad person, because of how I hurt you. Which was a bit ironic because when we were together, you always made me feel like I had a heart of gold. J.K Rowling once wrote that we all have both dark and light inside us, that what matters is the part we choose to act on and that’s who we really are. I’ve never told you this but your love and the way you saw me made me want to be a better person, it made me want to act on the light so that the way you saw me never changed. Ever since everything happened, I have been trying even harder to hold onto the little light that remained, so that if you ever came into my life again, you’d still be able to see me as a good person. 
They say that actions speak louder than words and although my actions have contradicted it, when I say that I have never stopped loving you since the day I started, I hope that you know I mean it, because when it’s that real it doesn’t fade. It may seem a bit contradictory that I’m claiming to love you and yet I hurt you so badly, but that’s what I hope to discuss in this piece; not to try and find excuses or justify what happened, but rather to just try and explain things from my perspective. 
I always say that I blame myself for both of our breakups. The biggest problem we faced when we decided to try again, was the fact that I hadn’t dealt with the past properly. In classic Zayyan fashion, I thought that I could bury things deep down until it disappeared. But that’s not the way things work, the more you try to bury things, the more they build up and the worse it becomes. I know that I’m the only one to blame, but I can’t help but wonder that if I had learned earlier on in life to deal with my emotions better, maybe I wouldn’t be having to write this. Maybe I wouldn’t have posted that video. Maybe I wouldn’t have said the things I said. Maybe I could have been what you needed. Maybe we’d still be together. But ‘what ifs’ and ‘maybes’ can’t change the past, nothing can. 
So I kept trying to bury the past hurt, unaware that slowly it was building up, unaware that eventually it would become too much and I’d explode. Over time, I buried so much that it began to feel like things weren’t working between us anymore. With all these things clouding my mind, it became hard to see the truth, that things were good, that you were perfect. Why didn’t I just communicate with you, like I said I would? Why didn’t I just deal with my shit? Fuck. Eventually I began to think that maybe I should end things. Because, again, with my mind clouded it became hard to realise that things were actually working. The other reason I thought about ending things was that I began thinking that I wasn’t good for you, again. I wrote this before, but the first time we dated I really began to feel like I was a rock holding you down. And I began to feel that way again. Because when we just got back together you seemed a lot happier than you were a few months down the line. When you told me you don’t think it would be good for you to be with me again, this kind of confirmed this in my mind. Again, why didn’t I just communicate with you? Perhaps I would have realised that you just had other stuff going on in your life. Fuck. 
Fast forward to the day I ended things. This isn’t an excuse but I was so hurt by seeing you out with other guys at 1am. People deal with hurt in different ways, my go-to response is anger. And the anger just worsened my already clouded judgement and I sent you that hurtful message, ending things. Maybe if I had just taken some time to calm down, we could have spoken about it, and we’d still be together. Fuck. For the record, I didn’t think you’d cheated on me, despite all the anger I felt, I would never think that low of you. And then I went and made things worse, by posting that video, and getting into a fight with your sister. Despite all that though, you still tried to message me. To try and meet up with me, so we could talk about things. I was so caught up in my own head that I said no. But I wish I hadn’t, I wish I had met up with you, so we could have worked things out. Fuck. FUCK!
I recently took a walk by the bench where we first kissed, or rather the bench where you first kissed me (as you’d say). It was dark, just like that night, and it was drizzling. It seemed so familiar and yet so distant, as though I was experiencing déjà vu. The difference was that I knew the memories I had were real, that the first time I felt your soft lips against mine was magic. I lingered for a bit, reminiscing, before it got too painful so I kept walking. Until I came to another familiar scene; the courts where we used to play tennis. I felt the knot in my stomach tighten as I was flooded with more memories. Like the time we got stuck in the courts and had to jump the fence. I turned around to walk back to my car, because I knew if I stayed there I would have drowned in memories so painful that I try to keep them locked away. I passed by that bench again and somehow managed a smile through the pain. I smiled because I know that on that night, all those years ago, we were magic. Every time I think of you I get this sharp, painful feeling flowing through my body starting from my heart and ending in my stomach, the best way I can describe is that it’s as though someone sends electricity through my veins instead of blood and I have to take a few seconds to ground myself. That feeling then stays in my stomach. What makes it worse is that it seems there is no limit to things that remind me of you. It doesn’t have to be places we’ve been, things we’ve spoken about or things we’ve done together. This makes it really hard to be around people, because at any moment my anxiety can get really bad, so instead I avoid people but spending time alone with my thoughts just pushes me further down the hole. It’s a vicious cycle that I can’t seem to stop. I watched this TED talk recently that spoke about the best thing for people suffering from anxiety and depression is to be around people close to them, but I just can’t, it’s too hard.
The hardest thing about anxiety is that it doesn’t stop, it doesn’t go away; it’s always there. Some moments are just worse than others. It can make you feel like you’re going crazy, to constantly be controlled by your thoughts and then feel a physical manifestation of those thoughts in your body as your heart beats faster, your stomach tightens, you struggle to breathe, your muscles tense up, your body trembles. I was standing in line at Woolworths one morning and, as usual, my mind flooded with thoughts (mainly about you) and my anxiety was through the roof. Naturally, I was restless, biting my nails, pulling at my hair, shaking my legs. Desperately trying to ground myself, I started watching the people around me. I noticed the lady in front of me was standing dead still so I turned around and saw that most of the others behind me were too (the ones moving were just checking the products on the shelves). That made it worse. In that moment it felt like I was crazy. I began to imagine what it’d be like to be someone else for a day, someone who doesn’t have this constant feeling like he’s about to implode. Everyone, at some point in their lives, experiences stress and anxiety. Professionals would tell you that it only becomes a disorder, or a problem, when it’s ongoing and starts to interfere with your daily life. For example, when you’re sitting in front of your laptop with your work open but can’t seem to bring yourself to focus, until weeks go by and you realise that you’ve fallen so far behind that catching up seems impossible, which in turn makes your anxiety worse. Or perhaps when at random points throughout the day you find yourself unable to breathe, when you can barely manage to eat half a cup of noodles without feeling like throwing up or perhaps it’s when you struggle to fall sleep because your body keeps convulsing and your head keeps spinning.  Maybe it’s a problem when you listen to artists like Kid Cudi and Phora on repeat because their music is so relatable that it provides some sort of faux-lifeline. Maybe it’s a problem when none of your habits seem to help for longer than a few minutes; smoking, driving your car like you’re on a racetrack, pushing yourself at gym. So you run to the pills, because it seems like the only thing that can help.
Do you know why people who are depressed cut? Because it can be very hard to feel all this pain internally and yet from the outside look like nothing is wrong. Imagine looking in the mirror, and you see exactly what you should see; your reflection. When you touch your left ear, your reflection follows suit. Every feature that defines you perfectly reflected. The problem is that, in the mirror, you look okay. You look like nothing’s wrong, and yet on the inside you’re barely holding onto life itself. Cutting then provides a way to physicalize that inner pain, and make it real. Cutting, or just self-harm in general, releases endorphins (feel-good chemicals) in the brain which can actually in that moment make you feel a bit better, which is why it can be so hard to stop. It is not always about suicide; sometimes people cut to try and feel more alive. Although I have never tried it, I can say that I understand, because it can be very hard to think that I may have to keep living feeling this way. That’s the thing about depression, it makes you feel like there’s no hope, which can be very dangerous. Depression is a bit harder to describe than anxiety because the symptoms aren’t as visible and it can be very easy to just think that someone suffering from it is just sad, but it’s so much more than just sadness. It’s a feeling of emptiness, numbness and hopelessness inside and nothing you do ever feels like it fills the missing piece. Not all the new phones, tv’s or sports cars you buy ever helps. It feels like the only hope you have is to run away, but the truth is that you can’t run and hide from yourself. You still smile, make jokes and laugh like everyone else but just like anxiety, it’s always there with you, like a dark cloud looming over you, while everyone around seems to basking in the sun, and it feels like you’ll never be able to join them.
I can’t say that I feel this way because of your absence in my life, these are things I’ve struggled with for a long time, but the situation I find myself in now is definitely a trigger, one which I can’t seem to avoid. Do you know what it’s like to feel your mental state deteriorating, knowing there is nothing you can do to stop it? The movie Joker had the most accurate representation of it that I’ve ever seen. Because it doesn’t happen all at once. It’s sort of like an inverse exponential graph, where you start off at this ‘high’ point where you feel relatively fine and then as time goes on you start to get bad, slowly at first. But once it starts getting bad, it gets worse quicker and quicker, until eventually you’ve lost yourself again. And each time it happens, feels worse than the last. What makes it even worse is having no one to turn to. No one who can help you get back up again.
I don’t know if you hate me, but you should know that I will always hate myself for the mistakes I’ve made, and the pain I’ve caused you and I know that doesn’t change anything but maybe it will help you realise just how sorry I am for everything. The hardest part of it all is knowing that there is no one to blame but me, but I guess that I just have to learn to forgive myself, no matter how long it takes. And I hope maybe you can too.
P.S. The waitress at Café Sofia, our waitress, asked me if we were back together. I told her we’re not and she asked why, so I just smiled and said ‘maybe one day’ but I know there isn’t much hope for that, only a fool’s hope. She told me we should get back together because we look like a good fit and I just smiled because damn, I couldn’t help but agree with her. She said she would pray for us because she’s a strong believer in prayer. But I didn’t write this to try and get you back or to justify what I’ve done. I wrote this for both of us. So that we both can understand better why I did the things I did and how I know now that it was a mistake. You told me you just wanted to know that I’m okay and at the time I had all these thoughts running through mind, things that I just couldn’t bring myself to tell you. But now you know and I guess you can decide for yourself if you think I’m okay or not. This isn’t even everything I would have wanted to say but maybe one day we’ll get to talk about it in person, but I know that isn’t very likely.
I know that no one else will ever be able to love me the way you did, and I’d like to think that no one would ever love you the way I do. I hope you find the happiness in this life that you deserve and sometimes I can’t help but wonder if maybe it’d be easier for you to move on and forget me if I was gone. And if I’m being honest, I don’t really know how much longer I can stay.
Sometimes, how good a thing was is forgotten in the way it ends and so if this is the end for us, I want the last words I say to be that I love you, my Princess. I always will. Always."
4,"“I want so much that is not here, and I don’t know where to go” – Charles Bukowski.
In this world where we are constantly bombarded with details about other peoples’ lives and success stories, it’s easy to often feel lost and like you’re always trying to find something that isn’t there. Even though people may look at you as someone with a degree and a decent job who seems to have it all figured out, you can still feel like there’s something missing, something you’ll never find. You may have the dream job, the dream car, good friends and a few hobbies you enjoy and yet a 1000-piece puzzle is still incomplete when only 999 pieces are used. And that one piece that’s missing, is the one piece you feel you need for everything to be okay. But no matter how hard you search, you can’t seem to find it.
What I’ve come to realise, is that it’s okay to feel this way; to feel lost. But we shouldn’t let this feeling distract from what we want to achieve in our lives, whether it be academically, professionally, romantically or otherwise. Every new day provides us with another 24 hours to take a step towards where we want to be, regardless of how big or small that step may be. Some days, we may not even take that step, or we may even take a few steps backwards, and that’s okay. In a time where everything is available to us almost immediately, we may forget that things actually take time; it takes time to get a degree, it takes time to build yourself up to where you want to be in your career and it takes time to find a person to fall in love and build a lasting relationship with. 
Sometimes, while pursuing our dreams, we may stumble, or even fall. But as Thomas Wayne said, we fall so that we can learn to pick ourselves up again. And that’s the most important part; learning to pick ourselves up again, no matter how hard it may be. You failed a test? Study harder or get help for the next one. A project at work wasn’t as impressive as you had hoped it would be? Work harder on the next one. You lost someone who you hoped would be in your life forever? Cry your eyes out, dry them and then get back on your feet.
Recently, I’ve been trying to shift my mindset from thinking that I’m lost, to thinking that I’m not lost, but rather that I’m on my way, on my way to where I want to be, to who I want to be. I’m trying to apply this mindset to every facet of my life because then I get to think that everything I’ve gone through, everything that I’m going through and will ever go through, is just part of the journey I’m on. And I think the journey is just as beautiful as the destination. All the failed tests, missed deadlines, heartbreaks, scraped knees, tears were all part of this beautiful journey that lead me to where I am today, and will lead me to where I want to be one day, to who I want to be.
Sometimes we may not even know where we want to be or what we want our lives to be like. Lately I have been trying to figure out which is worse, not knowing what you want out of life, or knowing exactly what it is you want and not having it. But maybe the worst feeling is knowing what you want but also knowing that you’ll never be able to have it. And although this is the situation I find myself in, I can’t help but hold onto this belief that I’m on my way and hope that one day I will wake up with everything I wanted, or better yet, everything I needed, and I will look back on these days not with a sore, empty heart but rather feeling full and content with my life. The best we can do is to remember to live, to take each day as it comes and to appreciate each moment to the fullest, even the bad ones. And though we should never lose sight of our dreams, we shouldn’t be disheartened when things turn out differently than we hoped. Because as J.K Rowling once wrote, it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.
Someone very important to me told me that no matter what I’m going through it’s important to constantly remind myself that I can get through it, that I’ll be okay. And though I haven’t felt okay in a long time, her words gave me the jumpstart I needed to get out of the slump I found myself in. So lately I have been trying to keep a positive mindset and keep myself busy doing anything with people who mean something, even if the one who means the most can’t be around anymore.  
And although I am still just a kid from the streets of Newclare trying to figure out exactly what my place in this crazy world is, it’s a lot more comforting to think that I’m on my way to figuring it all out, as opposed to thinking that I’m lost. And if anything, that’s the lesson I want you to take away from this: That, whenever you’re faced with any challenge in your life and it feels like the world is crumbling around you and you’re so lost that you don’t even know which way to go, you take a second to remind yourself that everything that’s happening to you is just part of the journey and that you’re not actually lost; you’re just on your way.

5,"In 1905 Albert Einstein proposed his theory of special of relativity, in which he described that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light in a vacuum (space without matter or air) was independent of the motion of all observers. In 1915, trying to include acceleration into his theory, he published the theory of general relativity which proposed the idea that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, which is felt as gravity. In order to understand this distortion we can think of the universe as a flat piece of paper. If one were to place a very light object on the paper, nothing would happen. If you then placed a tennis ball on the paper, a space of the paper would bend around the ball and any object placed in this bent part of the paper would gravitate towards the ball. In other words, the heavier the object, the bigger the area around it that gets curved, or ‘distorted’. Similarly, heavy objects (like planets, large stars and black holes) bend the space around them; for example, the Earth bends the space around it and because the moon is within this bent (or distorted) space, it is affected by the Earths gravity. Einstein’s theory was thought to be a massive breakthrough in physics and helped us understand the universe a little better, however its been found to breakdown when dealing with the mechanics of subatomic particles (particles that are smaller than atoms, for example protons)  which is a field known as quantum mechanics. Scientists have spent many years searching for a theory which reconciles Einstein’s theory with quantum mechanics; a theory of everything.
One the most famous, albeit controversial, ideas put forward is String Theory; which describes everything in the universe to be made up of tiny, 1-dimensional, vibrating string-like particles. It is thought that the way these string-like particles vibrate and interact with one another determines the structure and properties of the object it makes up and, in turn, the structure and properties of the universe. Within string theory is another interesting theory known as the Multiverse Theory which puts forward the idea that our universe is not the only one which exists, that there are in fact others which exist parallel to ours; parallel universes. 
Some scientists think that these universes are very similar to ours and that there could be copies of us that exist in these universes, some of whom may be similar to us and some who may be very different to us. For example, in one of these universes there could be a copy of me who is actually good at writing, but that’s just unrealistic. Other scientists think that these universes could be so different from ours that they follow fundamentally different laws of physics. Of course, no one has ever proven that these so-called parallel universes exist nor has there ever been any signs of their existence, or maybe just none that we have been able to observe yet. A few weeks ago I read an article which described how there are some scientists who believed that there is dark matter leaking into some galaxy from a parallel universe, currently, however, there is no way to prove this. 
In Islam we are taught that there are beings known as jinn; entities created from a smokeless-fire, who roamed the earth before Adam. These beings are said to exist in a universe that is parallel to ours, in which they can see and in some cases interact with us whereas we cannot see or interact with them. There is also a Quranic verse which translates to All praise belongs to God, Lord of the worlds. Fakhruddin Razi, an Iranian Sunni muslim theologian and philosopher raised the question whether the term “worlds” in this context meant “multiple worlds within this single universe” or to “many other universes (a multiverse) which exists beyond our known universe”. He concluded that even if a multiverse didn’t exist, it is definitely possible as the power of God knows no limits and He could create an infinite number of universes.
Is a bad person just a bad person? J K Rowling once wrote The world isn’t split into death eaters and good people. We have all got both light and darkness inside of us. What matters is the power we choose to act on, that’s who we really are. If we accept this logic, then surely we must accept that even some of the most ‘evil’ people have some good in them, which exists parallel to the bad. There is a man who stays in Newclare that is suspected to be a drug dealer, someone we might consider to be a bad person. But at the same time, he provides the people in the community with food, which is something that even the ‘good’ people, in the same community, fail to do.  
So maybe parallel universes do exist, just not in the way that we currently think of them. Maybe each person is like a universe and all the different parts of their personality are the parallel universes that make up who they are. There is an old Japanese proverb that says we have three faces; one we show to the world, one we show to close friends and family and one we only show to ourselves, which is the truest reflection of who we are. This may seem like an obvious fact, because it’s clear that most, if not all, of us have many different levels to who we are. And no, I don’t mean in the way that some girls think reading Paulo Coelho books gives them more substance. 
How many times have we met someone and a few weeks, months or even years afterwards we think that they have changed so much from the person we first met. Sometimes we may even think that we have changed. But maybe it’s not as simple as that. Maybe when we met we just failed to see the countless other universes that existed beyond the one that was shown to us and, over time, we began to become aware of their existence. That is surely how it feels with her.
When we first met, the part of me that she began to know, and fall in love with, was very different than the part of me she met when we had our last conversation. I often regret how her perception of me must have changed from this sweet, lovable person to someone so full of anger. The truth is, the anger was always there, even if she didn’t meet it till some time after we first met. Or maybe I just want to think that, because it would mean that the sweet, lovable person she met all those years ago still exists. In a black-and-white version of this story I am a villain but, of course, the world exists in color. Although I am a pretty closed up person, I have a habit of spilling things I don’t, can’t, tell anyone into the words of my stories but, in this case, I will avoid going into too much detail. I like to believe that, in her eyes, the hero inside me still exists, in parallel to the other side of me that broke her heart. I may never find this out, I may never want to. I don’t know whether I believe in the multiverse or not but I can say this; I like to think that there exists a version of us that was never jealous or insecure, a version of us that loves each other for who we are and not who we want each other to be. Most of all, I like to think that there is a version of us who overcame all the obstacles life threw at us and still wound up together; but then again, I ask myself, what if we are that version of us?
I think it’s important that we become aware that everyone we meet, and even those we think we know, are more than what they seem to be. And more than that, we should accept each other for all that we are. Maybe the reason that we like eye contact so much is that when our eyes meet another’s, we get a glimpse into the universes that reside within, waiting to be explored by someone who cares, someone who can understand. We sometimes find it easy to judge a person by something they’ve done. But I think that what really defines a person is much, much more than that. We are not defined by where we come from or the things we may have done, but rather by the potential that lies within and what we choose to do with that, who we choose to be. I think it’s only with that realization that we can really break through the boxes society has placed us in, and become much more than they ever intended. Because life is a story, and we are all the authors of our own destinies. Because you may just be a kid from the streets of Newclare but that doesn’t mean you have to fall into the vicious cycle of drugs and gangs that is all around you, you can aspire to something greater; the only limits are the ones that exist in your mind. The late Stephen Hawking once said There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. No matter how bad things may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at; while there is life, there is hope.

6,"Since the beginning of “intelligent” civilization, mankind has always wondered about where we come from, and where we’re going. Over the centuries, many theories have been formulated. In 1929 an astronomer named Edwin Hubble made some important observations that distant galaxies seemed to be moving away not only from each other, but from us as well, meaning that the universe is expanding.  This important discovery leads us to one logical conclusion; if the universe is expanding, then surely if we were to wind back the clocks and go back in time all those billions of years ago, we would find that the universe once existed as a single point, and this leads us to the big bang theory. 
13.8 billion years ago, the universe was very different to what we know it to be today, it was just a high density, high pressure point until a spectacular explosion occurred, which resulted in the universe being born. Although we haven’t yet been able to prove that the big bang actually happened, we do have some clues such like the fact that the universe is expanding, and it is still the most universally accepted model of the universe. The idea of the universe having a finite past is credited to many of the great thinkers of the past, including Persian born Muslim philosopher Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali.
A particle accelerator is an apparatus for accelerating subatomic particles (particles that are smaller than atoms) to high velocities by means of electric or electromagnetic fields. The accelerated particles are generally made to collide with other particles, either as a research technique or for the generation of high-energy X-rays and gamma rays. 100 hundred meters below the border of Switzerland and France there is a particle accelerator known as the Large Hadron Collider (or CERN supercollider) which scientists are currently running experiments on to try and prove the big bang theory, as well as better understand what exactly happened at the time the universe was created. 
By smashing protons together with enough force and speed, the CERN supercollider will cause protons to break apart into smaller atomic subparticles. These tiny subparticles are very unstable and only exist for a fraction of a second before decaying or recombining with other subparticles. According to the big bang theory, all matter in the early universe consisted of these tiny subparticles. As the universe expanded and cooled, these particles combined to form larger particles like protons and neutrons; in essence, they formed the universe. 
The funny thing is, these protons existed before the experiment; they had, in a way, their own individual stories, until they were made to collide, then their stories would forever be intertwined and told as one. Much like ours.
You see, I still believe that we were destined to meet; that life served as a particle accelerator, constantly taking us closer towards one another. Until it finally happened, we met, and our two separate tales became one. And the spectacular explosion that was our love caused ripples throughout space and time and created a new universe, one in which our story will never be forgotten. Although I only met you in the latter parts of my life, it does get hard to remember a time when you weren’t in my life, in some capacity. And even if now we’re just strangers with all these memories, you still exist in my mind, as an important part of me that will always be remembered.
For the first time in years I started a new year without you and I tried to hide it, but it was really hard for me to pretend like I was okay. I read the letter you wrote for me to read on our first new year’s eve together and I don’t have too much pride to admit I cried. I thought of the first time I read it; I was at a beach party in Singapore and I had to step out of the crowd because I literally fell to my knees because I couldn’t breathe. And then the clock struck 12 and everyone around me was celebrating but I was standing there like a weirdo, reading your letter. I remember feeling so content and happy at that moment.
I continued crying as I went on to read all the letters you’d ever written me, yes I still have all of them, even the not-so-serious ones. The beautiful thing is that they weren’t sad tears, I mean yes it hurt, but I was smiling as the tears rolled down my cheeks because it reminded me of how special you are, and just how real we were.
I wish I had met you earlier in life, so that we could have had some more time together before I fucked everything up. And I know you’re not coming back and I know exactly why, but I can’t help myself from still hoping you’ll be my forever, even if I know that’s not going to happen. I have been trying to make peace with the fact that you’re gone and most days I am able to pretend that I’m okay. At the very least, I know you’ll never be truly gone, because the ones we love never truly leave us, they’re always with us, in our hearts."
7,"In physics, the theory of everything is a hypothetical framework that would explain everything in the universe, from gigantic objects like black holes to tiny particles like protons. Currently, there are two different theories: Relativity and quantum theory. Albert Einsteins theory of general relativity attempts to explain the behavior of very large objects in the universe like planets, stars and black holes. Quantum theory attempts to explain the behavior of very tiny objects in the universe like protons. One of the biggest problems in physics is that general relativity and quantum theory don’t seem to play very well together; Einsteins theory doesn’t hold for subatomic particles. For years, scientists have been trying to find a framework that would reconcile relativity with quantum theory and to date none has been found. Some scientists argue that the name theory of everything is deceiving because even if such a framework is proven to exist it wouldn’t answer all our questions about the universe, but would rather open the door for us to know what questions we should be asking. This idea is also present in philosophy. A philosophical theory of everything would answer questions like ‘Why is reality understandable?’ or ‘Why is there anything at all?’
I think an often overlooked area in which a theory of everything exists is relationships. I often try to reconcile why certain relationships work and why others fail. Of course, this is a difficult question to answer; whether you’re asking it about your own relationships or other peoples’.  Most people have probably had at least one relationship they thought, hoped, would last forever. Looking back at the black box of those failed relationships there may be reasons as to why things didn’t work out but I think we often find ourselves wondering why those reasons were enough to come between all the love we had for that person. I think if we want to answer this question, there are two big ideas we must consider.
The first is the idea of destiny. In Islam, the belief that God has designed a plan for all of us (predestination) is one of the six articles of Iman (faith). This means that everything in our lives from the day we are born to the day we die has been written before we were even conceived. It follows, then, that the Quran also has a verse which translates to “We created you in pairs”. This ties in to the common belief that everyone has someone in this world that they’re meant to end up with; a soulmate. The definition of a soulmate is “a person ideally suited to another as a close friend or romantic partner”. I’ve always been the type to believe in soulmates, to believe that somewhere out there is someone who is a perfect fit for me but after having been in love (thinking, hoping, she was my soulmate) I find myself questioning the whole concept altogether. Not in some sad way that I think I’ll die alone, but rather just taking a more logical approach. On the surface, the idea of soulmates is very intriguing, but once we start to question it we realise that it’s actually not built on a very solid foundation and it all comes crumbling down, like a house of cards. The most obvious question is; what if my soulmate dies before I’ve met them? Does that mean then whoever I end up with is just a consolation prize? I sure hope not. I like to believe that one person could have multiple soulmates and ending up with any one of them would be more than enough to make you happy. 
I think the biggest problem many relationships face is that most people are more interested in ending up with the person who sets their hearts on fire, figuratively of course. I once read a post that posed the question “is love a choice or a feeling?” and when I was younger and more naïve I confidently answered “it’s a feeling, of course”. The post went on to state that, more often than not, marriages lasted longer when the couples believed love was a choice and marriages ended when the couples believed it was a feeling. The post made the argument that love was a very unstable foundation on which to build a relationship. Because there may be days where you love your partner less and would then have to make the choice to stay with them, to keep loving them. As hard as it is to admit, just believing that someone is your soulmate and that they were made for you is not enough to build a successful relationship. At most, it is only one half of the equation. Which brings us to the second idea. 
The second is the idea of compatibility. Compatibility is defined as “a state in which two things are able to exist or occur together without problems or conflict”. I think one of the reasons a lot of people find their relationships failing is that they’re always looking for the person who’ll make their hearts skip a beat and not the person who they’re most compatible with. Of course, humans are all unique and the chances that you’ll meet someone with whom you have no problems or conflict is very, very small. The difference comes in when you choose a partner that you’re compatible with. Someone whose life and personality fits together with yours. For example, if you’re someone who prefers spending intimate time with people closest to you, you probably wouldn’t be compatible with someone who prefers to be at parties whenever there is one. This, however, introduces the notion of compromise. The party-goer may help the introvert come out of their shell and the introvert may help the party-goer realise the beauty in spending a Saturday night doing nothing with someone who means everything. 
Because humans are unique and complicated it can be a bit difficult to spot someone who you’re compatible with. But I believe that when you find them, you will have one of the healthiest and happiest relationships you’ve ever been in. In a time where almost everything is available to us almost immediately, we’ve lost patience. When we want something, we want it now; when we want someone to make us happy, we want them now. But if we want to find someone we’re compatible with, we have to learn to be patient, and enjoy the process of getting to know someone. Knowing who they are and, furthermore, knowing what makes them who they are. Knowing what makes them happy, sad, or angry. Knowing how their smile forms, or how their tears fall. Knowing the things they hate as well as the things that set their hearts on fire. And knowing someone takes time. Sometimes we may meet someone and immediately feel a connection to them and mistake this for compatibility. Only to found out, a few months and two broken hearts down the line, that you were never compatible.
As with soulmates, there are definitely multiple people you will meet that you are compatible with. So the question is then, how does one decide on who they should be with? I think that the answer is that we should look for the few people that are at the intersection of ‘someone who makes my heart skip a beat’ and ‘this is someone I’m actually compatible with’. As with physics, this theory of everything will not provide a complete answer to everything we want to know about successful relationships, but will rather provide us with a much stronger foundation on which to build relationships that are more likely to end up successful. As a person who has been in a relationship, that didn’t work out, with someone who fell into this intersection, I can personally say that even this strong foundation is not enough; it just give you a better chance.
It may take time and you may get impatient but it’s important to always remember that this is just part of the process. And that there is someone out there for you to fall hopelessly in love with. The best you can do in the interim is just work on yourself and your own goals and wait until you find them, or they find you. Islam teaches us a valuable lesson about destiny, what’s meant for you will never miss you even if it’s beneath two mountains and what’s not meant for you will never reach you even if it’s between your lips.

8,"Is time just a concept created by humans? 
Our universe exists in three spatial dimensions, all of which we can see, measure and move freely through. Time is sometimes thought of as being the fourth dimension however it is not something we can see or move freely through (we cannot move backward through time, only forward), it is something that we can only feel. Since the beginning of the universe, the ‘arrow of time’ has begun moving forward, and will continue until the universe reaches its inevitable end.
Einstein taught us that time is relative. That for someone who is closer to a black hole where there is a stronger force of gravity, time will run slower as compared to someone who is on Earth. Of course, this hasn’t been proven yet, but it makes me wonder; what is time? You see, our whole concept of time is defined by how long it takes the Earth to complete a rotation around the Sun; that’s how we get a year. We also measure how long it takes the Sun to move across the sky; a day. We then have hours, minutes and seconds. Our whole lives are based around these random man-made measurements. We spend every week waiting for Friday. Every month waiting for December, often forgetting to actually enjoy and appreciate each moment of our lives, both the good and the bad. 
Over the centuries, we’ve become so obsessed with quantifying everything. Race, age, nationality. As a species we’ve defined so many imaginary boxes for ourselves and then we go to war over these imaginary divisions, we must be crazy. I think somewhere along the way we forgot that we aren’t enemies, a lesson that will forever be immortalized in the words of JK Rowling who wrote ‘While we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one’. I think the reason we cling to these quantifications is that as a species we are too young, and naïve, to understand the concept of forever; the idea of infinity. 
Maybe we can’t understand forever because we’re so used to things ending; relationsips, friendships, jobs, degrees and even life itself. Or maybe it’s because we don’t pay enough attention to the things that are infinite; God, the soul, the universe (to some extent) and love. You see, when love is real, it’s from the soul and since the soul never dies, neither does real love. Over and over again Islam has taught us that Gods love for us is infinite, and when we really love someone maybe it’s at least a fraction of the love that God has for us, and a fraction of infinity is still infinite (mathematicians forgive me for that one).
I still remember the first girl I thought I loved. We cared for each other so much, but we weren’t a good fit and things ended. As people usually do, we promised that we’d love each other forever and that we’d try again. But as time went on, it began to become clear to me (and I think to her as well) that what we felt was real, but it wasn’t love. And that even though we still cared about each other, we weren’t meant to be together. So we both moved on and although we don’t even have each others’ numbers saved anymore, I like to think that she’s happy. And then there’s her.
As clichéd as it might sound, the thing about real love is that you don’t go looking for it; it finds you. You don’t meet someone and immediately think ‘Wow I’m really going to fall in love with this person’, you just start to feel it, slowly at first, and then with every cell in your body. It fills you and though it is just an emotion, you can feel it physically. And when you feel it, you just know it’s real, because all the crushes, infatuation and lust you felt before can’t compare. 
Skeptics and scientists may tell you that love is just the result of chemical reactions in the brain which can be artificially created in a lab, but I don’t think these people understand that love, real love, stems from the soul, and perhaps these chemical reactions in the brain is just the body’s way of trying to understand and react to what’s going on. Because let’s not forget, our bodies are just a tool, that God gave our souls in order to interact with this physical world He created for us.
We’ve always searched for the meaning of life and I have a theory that it’s love. My theory is that it’s no coincidence that all the infinite things (the ones we know of, at least) are intertwined with one another; love is from the soul, the soul is from God and God had no beginning and will have no end; God is truly infinite. I believe that by taking the time to understand ourselves and everything that makes us who we are (i.e our souls) we will begin to understand love better and in turn we will begin to move closer to God.
“Just give it time” they’ll tell you, “In time you’ll move on”. But I think that because love is infinite, we can’t use this finite measurement of time to reconcile when we think love will end. Because days, weeks, months and even years will pass and I know I’ll still feel the same. Unfortunately, I know how this movie ends for me. Eventually, she will move on and forget about me. Because I’m forgettable; not in the sense that I didn’t hold a significant place in her life or her heart, but in the sense that I made her want to forget me. I’d like to think that I’m not scared of anything but I’d be lying if I said that I’m not terrified that one day I will bump into her and I’ll see my soulmate on someone else’s arm, and all she will see is someone she used to know, someone she used to love.
I think the hardest part about losing someone you love is when you know they still love you too but they don’t want to be around anymore. When someone’s love for us fades, we can’t always blame them. Because sometimes, we’re the ones who pushed them away, and we taught them how to not love us anymore, maybe because we were never taught how to love ourselves. I’d like to say that it’s okay, but it’s not, even though it has to be. At the very least, though, I think I have made peace with the fact that one day her once boundless love for me will fade, if it hasn’t already. 
Over and over again, I’ve said that love is infinite, so how then can I be so sure that hers for me will fade? It’s not that I think it wasn’t real, because it was, but science teaches us that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. And I think that’s how it will be for her; all the love she once had for me will be transferred, maybe to someone else, but I hope that instead she loves herself, and finds peace and happiness in her life, no matter where it may take her. Maybe one day I will too.

9,"Part 1: Al-Ahmaloo (The Hope)
A feeling of expectation and desire for a particular thing to happen, that’s the official definition of hope. Of course, in reality the meaning is far deeper than that. Without something to hope for, what is the point of living? The thing I hoped for most, was someone to love. For as long as I can remember I have always been the type to “catch feelings” for girls. So basically, I have always been a hopeless romantic, with complete hope that one day I would find my soulmate and we would fall in love and the world would be a little less lonely than before. To this day I can remember the first time I felt a type of way about a girl, not that at that tender age I could even comprehend what the words “crush” or “feelings” meant. This first part is about one of my more notable childhood crushes, and how she would eventually change my life, and I am still deciding if it is for the better or worse. I guess our story starts where most childhood friendships start, with our families being friends. This meant at most gatherings she was there. I still remember getting a weird, nervous feeling in my stomach every time she was around, crazy right? Despite that craziness, however, I still remember being with her and my cousins and “playing” those games we all played as children. Cops and robbers, hide and seek, touchers etc­. Of course, to the innocent mind of a child, that anxious/nervous feeling in my stomach didn’t really mean much and so I continued focusing on the games and my favorite video game of all time, Crash Bandicoot, which always held my attention at Spur while they did God knows what. I can honestly say that a part of me has always, and probably will always, associate Spur and Crash Bandicoot with her (hopefully no future girlfriend prospects read this otherwise I’ll be banned from my favourite restaurant and game) So that’s how it went for a while, I’m not sure how long exactly, until, as it always does, life happened. Our families had a fallout, the details of which are too personal to share with the world, and that was that. I can’t say that her absence in my life affected me in any way, I mean I was just an 8 year old after all. The years went by, I grew up a little and so did she. True to form, feelings for other girls came and went. Some staying longer than others. I had a few girlfriends along the way, but as a teenager none of those were serious in any way. And that was life. Until one day I received a message on Facebook which read “Hey sweetz, remember me?” and I replied in the most honest way I possibly could, Who could forget? And that sparked an interesting phase in our relationship. Obviously at the time neither of us could have really guessed just how much those two messages would impact our lives. Because from those two messages came frequent conversations, walls being broken down, and connections which I had never experienced before, forming. This girl, who I had known many years ago, had now become my best friend. Even though we never saw each other, she felt closer than most. As an introvert, those sort of connections were rare to me, and yet I couldn’t stop this one. Eventually, as in a lot of boy-girl best-friendships, deeper feelings developed. This, unfortunately, brought along a lot of jealousy, and regrettably, a lot of hurt. If you ever read this, I am truly sorry for all of it. We even stopped speaking for a few months at a time, yet somehow one of us would always find our way back to the other, and the other was always willing to welcome them back. Maybe if I had just left you alone, things would have been different. For about four years, this on again off again friendship was our relationship. Until one year, I found my way back to her yet again and things took a different turn, our conversations took a different turn. Feelings I didn’t even know I had for her started showing themselves. Unfortunately I had eyes for another girl and wound up hurting her, again. I’m sorry. If you had asked me at that point, 4 years ago, if I saw a future with her I probably would have said something like I’ve hurt her too many times, she’ll never talk to me again. And yet, a few months later I messaged her again. And surprisingly, she took me in, again. This time was completely different, I was fully invested in it, and so was she. For the first time since our first messages on Facebook, we made plans to meet up and actually stuck to it. I went to her house and as my father pulled up he recognized the house. “Do you remember this house?” he said, “Do you remember coming here?” However it did not seem familiar to me. I went in and I couldn’t believe, four years later, we were finally together. This girl I had shared the most intimate parts of myself with and I, finally together in the same room. I still remember the feelings of excitement and nervousness I felt. I still remember what movie was playing on tv, The Hunger Games. I remember feeling so comfortable that eventually all the nervousness seemed to go. I remember sitting next to her, and just talking. I remember the first time we kissed. I remember her taking the ring I was wearing on my right fourth finger. I remember smoking a pipe with her and her cousin. I remember my father coming to pick me up, and not wanting to leave. After that, things just seemed to fall into place, we had our first date, I re-met her mother, she re-met my parents, we started dating. And it seemed like my lifelong hope was finally coming into fruition. It seemed perfect for a while, until it stopped. I don’t know why, but jealousy began to take over me. Not only of other guys, but also other people in her life. I began to feel insecure, something which I couldn’t understand as it was completely new to me. I don’t consider myself a very intelligent person, but considering my logic centric degree along with my longtime interest in the world around me as well as the cosmos above me, I had a somewhat decent understanding of my external world and yet despite this, I had a poor understanding of my internal world. This killed me. This jealousy led to fights. I had certain expectations and so did she, which led to more fights. Eventually we got to a point where we loved each other more than we were in love with each other. My hope slowly fading. I remember my biggest insecurity had come to life; she was talking to another guy. In her defense I believe it was just friendly at the time but it killed me. I remember sitting on the bus one day, going home from university, and asking her if she had feelings for him. I don’t know, she said. I was sitting down, but I swear I felt light headed. Everything around me seemed to be spinning. The words I don’t know playing in my mind over and over again. Driving me insane. Despite the disorientation I knew what I had to do, “I’ll come to you tonight and we can break up” my next text read. I don’t even remember driving there that night. I just remember sitting on the couch, that same couch where we had our first kiss, and holding her as she cried on my shoulder. She cried her heart out. I tried convincing myself it was for the best, though. After a while, she went to get something and when she came back she opened my hand and put the ring in it. I knew it was over. I don’t remember driving home that night either. I do remember the weeks that followed, though. We said we’d stay friends and I actually visited her again once. It was different though. That night when I got home I told her I don’t think we can be friends anymore. It was too hard, knowing that the girl I loved, was talking to someone else. It was also the night I got introduced to the song which even now, 3 years later, is one of my favorite songs, Sinner by Phora. Something very important I’ve learned the hard way actually comes from a quote I like, Learn to let go of anything that no longer benefits you. Based on personal experience and what I’ve seen in others around me, this is a difficult skill to learn. I think maybe it’s because we don’t want to believe that we gave our best to someone, and it wasn’t good enough, but sometimes it isn’t. It also took me a long time to accept the role I played in the relationships end, and an even longer time to forgive myself. It’s funny thinking about it now, the girl who gave me hope, was the same one who destroyed it.

Part 2: Al-iiman (The faith)
This second part actually interconnects a lot with part 1, a lot more than I originally thought. This story revolves around a different type of relationship. For a long time, I had faith that this girl and I would end up together. We met in high school and from the first time I met her, I had a big crush on her. She was actually one of the girls who caused some of the jealousy I spoke about in part 1. Not that she could ever know that. The reason I had faith that we’d end up together was that I always seemed to come back to my crush on her. I never knew what it was, I still don’t, but something about her intrigued me so much. Let me explain a bit further what I mean. Like I said, after meeting her I had a crush on her, and then I had a crush on another girl (also the cause of much jealousy in part 1) for about 2 years, and then there was her again, and then another two girls, and then her again. It was after my last year of high school that I thought I was over her. And yet, the following year she was the reason I hurt the girl from part 1. It’s actually quite funny how these two different parts in my life are so interconnected. So for another year I was again chasing after this girl. Despite my feelings, however, we were actually quite close as friends, I don’t know how to explain it but we just really got along as friends. There were a few other girls in that year, but it was always her I wanted. The end of the year came and I guess I realised that we were better off as friends. It was actually at that point I also realised I had let go of someone I really cared about and could have a potential future with, for something that would probably never happen. And that was the beginning of my realization of my true feelings for the girl in part 1. It’s funny how things work out. And that was it, I had let my feelings for her go and instead explored my feelings for my childhood crush. Towards the end of my relationship, though, I ran into this girl again and we had made plans to meet up the following week. I remember we were speaking about a show we both liked called How I met your mother and how I related so much to the main character Ted, who spent the entire show searching for his soulmate. Shortly after that my relationship had ended but this girl and I had started spending more time together and the feelings I thought I had let go of suddenly found their way back. My faith was restored. I was so sure that this was a sign that things were going to work out, given the timing of it all. I learned another important lesson the hard way, again. This time it actually came from Ted, when he said “maybe it's dumb to look for the signs from the universe! Maybe the universe has better things to do. I mean, dear God, I hope it does. You know how many signs I've gotten, that I should or shouldn't be with someone? And where has it gotten me? Maybe there aren't any signs. Maybe... maybe a locket's just a locket, and a chair's just a chair. Maybe we don't have to give meaning to every little thing. And maybe we don't... Maybe we don't need the universe to tell us what we really want. Maybe we already know that. Deep down” This quote actually spoke to me a lot because he was saying this to a girl who he also had faith would be the one he’d end up with (in his case, though, he eventually did end up with her) In her defense however, something might have come of us, if I hadn’t met the next girl, the girl who completely changed my life…but that’s getting ahead of the story. I hope this girl and I stay friends for a long time, though, and maybe one day when we’re old and married (if I ever get married, that is) I’ll ask her about it, if she ever thought we could be something more.

Part 3: Almasir (The desiny)
This story is the hardest for me to write. Not only because it is the most recent, but also because it had the biggest impact on me. It has changed me, but we’ll get to that. This story ties in with the first two parts in an almost perfect way. See, after I had broken up with my childhood crush and was back to crushing on the girl in part 2, I met this girl. The way we met is actually like something out of a movie. One of my friends (the same one who introduced me to Sinner) had met this girl and her friend while studying one day and when he found out they were doing the same subject I had passed the year before, he told them they should ask me for some help. So he gave them my number and he also gave me theirs. At this point, however, I was still dating the girl in part 1. So time went on and I grew curious to find out who these girls are. Eventually, in ways I won’t mention here, I found out who they were. Funny enough, this girl was actually someone I used to see in my math class and found very attractive. One day, when I was single again, I got a message from her asking if I still had my notes for that subject and we agreed to meet so that I could give them the notes. I don’t know why, but I suggested meeting instead of emailing her. If I had emailed her, maybe things would have been so different. I still remember the day we first met. We actually had on the same colour t shirts, jeans and shoes. She came into the computer labs with me, where I was sitting with one of my other friends, and I copied the notes. We spoke, and it was weirdly comfortable. I usually don’t have conversations with people I don’t know, because I’m such a loner, but I found it very easy to talk to this girl. When she left my friend and I had a conversation about her and I told him how we started speaking. After that day I really wanted to get to know this girl so I kept trying to make plans with her. Every time, though, it seemed like she had a different excuse. I later found out, however, that they weren’t actually excuses. Eventually I decided to give up trying, keep in mind though that at this time I was also meeting up with the girl in part 2 quite a bit, which is why I said maybe something could have happened, if things worked out differently. One Friday night, the girl in part 2 wasn’t available to chill with my cousins and I so I decided to try again with this girl, Tell me I’m ugly I told them (something we tell each other when we need some confidence) I messaged her and to my surprise we made plans for Monday. Monday came and we met up and it was so comfortable, we just smoked and spoke for a while but eventually I had to go to my next class, I remember wanting to skip it (something I did frequently anyway) but she convinced me to go. Looking back, I should have skipped it because I don’t even remember what class it was, let alone what I learnt, but I do remember her. After that day the next time we met up, we went out with some of my friends. I remember seeing her for the first time that night, she looked so beautiful, it felt like my heart would explode. The night went on, we all smoked, spoke, played a few games of pool and danced. When it was time to leave I remember asking one of my friends if I should kiss her, and he said not yet, I should ask her out on a date first. So as we were leaving I told one of my other friends the plan and he told the others to fall back. I walked her to her car, and we stood there speaking. I wanted to ask her out, but I was so nervous. Eventually I told myself I’m ugly and did it. Uhhhh, yeah sure she replied. And I joked that she sounded so unsure. My friends came out and we all left. I remember our first date perfectly, we went for pizza at this candle-lit pizza place and afterwards we went to walk around the university (that’s where I left my car) I remember wanting to kiss her so badly, but feeling so nervous. Eventually she said “What would you do if I were to kiss you right now?” and I looked into her eyes and pulled her towards me and we kissed. It was almost like magic. After that night we started spending a lot more time together. And eventually we became a couple. Things were perfect, to say the least. I won’t get into too much detail because I believe some of it should stay just for us. I remember thinking It must be destiny because of how perfect it was. I remember the first time we said I love you to each other, she said it first but I meant it more, or at least I believe I did. All good things come to an end though, or that’s how the saying goes. You see, when you start dating someone you want to spend all your time with them, you forget about everyone else in your life (unintentionally of course) but another very important lesson I learned the hardest way is that absence really does make the heart grow fonder (not that we didn’t love each other, because we did). What I learned was that the more time you spend with someone, especially someone you love, the more space you leave for jealousy and insecurity. Yes, the green eyed monster I thought I had buried long ago had come back to haunt me. This time was different though, I tried to fight it, I tried to beat it. And I did. But it was too late, my inner demon had found its way to her. If you ever read this I’m really sorry, I hope you can forgive me one day. Eventually our jealousy and insecurities led to fights and fights and more fights. Again, I won’t get into too much detail because some things are just for us. We stayed together, though. Through all the break ups, through all the fights, through everything. We stayed together. Sometimes I wish we hadn’t, sometimes I feel as though it would have been a little bit easier if we hadn’t gotten back together after the first break up. I tried to remember the lesson, Learn to let go of things that no longer benefit you. The problem was that when things were bad, they were really bad, but when things were good, they were so good that it was easy to forget the bad, no matter how bad it got. So we held on, we fought to stay together. We had promised each other once that we would always keep fighting. That we would never give up on each other. I realize now, however, that isn’t a fair promise to make. Not to someone else, and not to yourself. Because sometimes, no matter how much it breaks you, you have to let go. That’s just how life is, and unfortunately we can’t do anything about it. I love her, and I think a part of me always will. I can’t even begin to describe the pain I go through on a daily basis… I can’t go on with this one, I’m sorry. It’s too much…

Part 4: Altatawur (The evolution)
If you’ve made it this far, you probably can relate to at least one of these stories (if you can relate to all 3, I am truly sorry for your pain) When I started writing this story, I wasn’t sure what the purpose was, but now that I’ve reached the end, I realise that I needed to become the person I need. If you take away anything from this story, I hope it’s that you need to be strong for yourself. You need to know when to stop putting other people before yourself. You need to fight for you because if you don’t, who else will? There’s only so much that other people can do for you, but your strength and your support needs to come from within. Another reason is that I feel there is no one I can talk to about it. People only listen to your story so many times before they get tired and tell you to “just move on already”, but they don’t understand. There is no moving on. Sometimes I wish I still had my best friend, I feel like she is the only person I could talk to. I still check up on her now and then and she seems happy, but it also seems like there is no place in her life for me anymore. Ted from How I met your mother once said When you care about someone, you should want them to be happy, even if you wind up being left out, and for me that applies to all three of these girls I care about, I want them to be happy. I am not a particularly religious person, I was born a Christian but now I am an agnostic. The reason I chose Arabic names for the titles, is that out of all the languages I’ve learnt, Arabic is the most beautiful for me. I do not usually pray much but after my hope was crushed, my faith shaken and my idea of destiny distorted, I pray every single day. I hope God listens. Something that has intrigued me recently is evolution. Whether you believe in creationism or the theory of evolution, there is a universal truth that you must accept; all living organisms evolve. Some of these evolutions happen very slowly, to a whole species whereas some of these happen over a relatively short period of time, to individuals. Think about what happens if you stay in the bath or a pool for a long time, your fingertips get wrinkly, this is to allow us to have better grip underwater. This is an example of an evolution that happens relatively quickly, to individuals in a population. Another type of this evolution is going through something that changes you. Something that can make a guy who believed in love his whole life question if it’s even a real thing, or just something we humans made up. Something that makes a guy who spent years searching for a soulmate, not even think that such a thing exists anymore. Something that can turn a guy who was friendly to most people he met, into a cold person. Everyone blames the “fuck boy” for being what he is, but no one ever stops to ask him about the time he got his heart broken. The name of this story is a semi colon. In pieces of writing the semi colon represents the fact that the author had intended to end a sentence but chose to instead continue. These days it has a different meaning, these days it is worn as tattoo, symbolic of the fact that the wearer had intended to end his/her life but chose instead to live, to keep living, to hope for a better tomorrow. Tonight, as I sit outside in this cold winter evening, with my tear-filled eyes, smoking this pipe, sipping my now-cold tea, I realise that’s what it means to me.

Yours Truly
Andrew Johnson (A.J)"
10,"23 December 2014
He looked up and suddenly she was gone. He stood in the road outside his house, left alone with the moon and stars, which shone above ever so brightly as though a dark cloud hadn't just settled over his entire world.

4 months later, 4 April 2015
Adam Webber walked up to the practice of David Hill, a psychologist in the local clinic. Out of habit, he scrutinised the room before walking in. He could see a bookshelf just opposite the door, in the far right-hand corner he saw a large window, in front of which were two armchairs facing each other, separated by a coffee table. He turned to the right and saw the doctors desk in the corner, facing the window. There was another smaller bookshelf next to the desk. David, who was standing in front of the larger bookshelf smiled and began to speak, ""Please, come in"", motioning for Adam to enter the room. ""Thanks...I'm not quite sure what to call you yet""  Adam walked towards David, holding out his hand. ""Call me anything you like, David, doc, Dave, sir, buddy, whatever feels comfortable"" replied David, shaking Adams hand and smiling. ""Okay, I think I'll stick with doc"" Adam replied and David led him to the two chairs in front of the window. When they got there Adam stopped and stared out of the window where he could see some trees which had grown around a pound in a field of the greenest grass he had ever seen. After staring for a few seconds he realised he had started smiling and looked down, ""I see why your desk is facing the window now...You know, doc, I believe that just because one is depressed it doesn't mean one cannot smile at pretty things, do you think I could turn my chair to face the window?"" he asked. ""Yeah sure, whatever feels most comfortable to you...and I totally agree with that statement, I think it could go deeper to say that depressed people appreciate pretty things a lot more than those who are not, but that's a topic for another day. For now, let's just talk about you"" replied David, sitting down in his armchair and facing Adam, who was now staring out of the window. ""Well, I suppose we should...though, I'm not exactly sure how this works yet, so maybe you could start by asking me questions?"" Adam asked, turning to look at David, who now sat with a pen and a note pad in hand. ""Ok, that's fine by me...So what are you doing at the moment? Studying or working?"" David asked. ""Studying a BA degree, with hopes of becoming a journalist one day"" Adam replied. ""Journalism? That's quite interesting. Why, may I ask, that field?"" he asked. ""I love travelling, and writing, and journalism is one of the few careers which utilises both of those skills, if not journalism then I think I'd like to be a travel writer, though I think poetry is where my true passion lies"" Adam replied, looking over at his psychologist and letting out a half smile, before returning his gaze to the window again. ""Have you written many poe...?"" Adam nodded before David could even finish his question. ""What about?"" David enquires, sounding genuinely interested. ""I don't know, I used to write about life , I guess, I used to just write about any ideas or beliefs I had about life. But I don't want to talk about that just yet"" Adam replied. ""So, you made a remark about depressed people, do you feel like you're depressed? If so, then why?"" David asked, setting his pen on the top page and getting ready to write. Adam laughed a little. ""No no, I don't think I'm depressed, doc, I'm 100% sure I am. And the reason is quite simple: Ivy Phillips. It's funny how those two words basically describe my greatest joy and at the same time my greatest sorrow"" he said, scratching at his beard with his right hand. David shifted into a more comfortable position in his seat, folding his legs and setting the notepad on his lap. ""Ahh, I understand. How unfortunate, or maybe fortunate, you are, to be so young and yet to have already experienced the pains of love. Tell me about her, where did you first meet this girl?"" he asked. ""Well, it was last year, early in the year..."" he began to have a flashback of the day he first met her.

It was still the first teaching block of the year, about three weeks after lectures had started. Adam was now in his second year at WITS University and had decided to join the photography club. Their first assignment was to take pictures of anything on campus that they thought was picture-worthy. The first thing Adam decided to take a picture of was the steps outside the central block building, but taken from the library lawns so that the fountain and the jacaranda trees were in the picture. He stepped onto the lawns and found the perfect spot to take the picture. He looked at the picture on the screen of his Canon digital camera and realised there was someone sitting alone underneath one of the jacaranda trees. It was a girl. She seemed to be listening to music and reading a book. Adam moved in to get a close-up of her. Before taking the picture he stopped for a moment to appreciate the beautiful sight of this pretty girl sitting under a pretty tree, then he took the picture and made sure it was okay on the screen on his camera, when he looked up again she was standing right in front of him, still holding her book. ""Well, is it a good picture?"" she asked. For a few seconds he was left speechless, partly because of how beautiful she was, partly because he was sure she hadn't seen him taking the picture. Before speaking he scrutinised her, out of habit. She was roughly his height, her skin was light brown, her hair was brunette and had a reddish tone to it and in the sunlight he could see that her eyes were brown. Her hair was tied up in a bun. She was wearing a blue dress with blue sneakers. ""Hello?"" she asked, waving her hands in front of his face, trying to bring him back from wherever he had just disappeared to. He laughed a little. ""Sorry. Yes, it's a good picture"" he said, smiling. ""Would you like to see?"" he asked, holding out his camera. She took the camera and looked at the screen for a few seconds before handing it back. ""What are you going to do with it?"" she asked. ""Well, I'm going to look at it again at home. And if I like it, I'm going to keep it for my assignment, if not I'll delete it"" he replied. ""Okay. You could have asked first, you know. I wouldn't have said no"" she said, walking back to her spot under the tree. He decided to follow her, feeling intrigued by her. ""I prefer taking them when people aren't aware. That way everything is so natural, the emotion is real, you know? I think that's when people are the most beautiful, when they think no ones looking"" he says. ""Wow that's...that's cool actually, I've never thought about it like that"" she said, sitting back down in her spot. ""Can I join you?"" he asked, looking down at her. ""Sure, why not?"" she replied, smiling. ""I'm Adam, by the way"" he said, sitting opposite her. ""Ivy"" she replied. ""So what are you doing here all by yourself?"" he asked. She lifted the book up, ""Sometimes I prefer the company of music and books, you know?"" she said, putting the book down again. ""Kind of...I'm more of a writer than a reader, though"" he replied, crossing his legs and leaning back on one arm, the camera next to him. ""Oh. What have you written?"" she asked. ""Mostly poems, but I've written some short stories as well"" he said, reaching out for her book: The Perks of Being A Wallflower. ""I'd love to read them some time, I like poems"" she said, wrapping her earphones around her iPod. ""We'll see, I don't generally let people read them...I've read this book, thought it was pretty average to be honest"" he said, putting the book down. ""I'm sure you can make an exception for me. I mean, after all, you did just take a picture of me without my permission"" she says, smiling. He smiles and looks down, ""I guess so"", she picks up the book and looks at the front cover. ""And I disagree. This is my second time reading it, I think it's absolutely brilliant, especially the way it's written as his diary entries, it makes it so... real"" she put the book down again and looked at Adam. They make eye contact for the first time and for a few seconds neither of them blinked or looked away. Then suddenly her eyes went wide, as though she had just remembered she had forgotten the stove on at home, and Adam looked down. She put her book and iPod in her bag and stood up. ""I've gotta go, my dad will be here soon"" she said, as Adam stood up. ""I know we just met but, could I have your number? I'd love to talk to you some more"" he said, smiling. ""Honestly, I thought you'd never ask"" she replied, winking. He hands her his phone and she saves her number. ""I'll dial it, just so you can be sure, yeah?"" she said, and her phone started ringing in her pocket. Adam smiled and all he was able to say was ""It's nice to meet you"" before she walked away. He turned around and bent down to pick his camera up.

When he looked up again he was back in the office of his new psychologist, staring out of the window again. ""Really? Sounds like a scene out of a movie, to be honest"" said Dr Hill, still writing Adams story in his notepad. ""I know...that's what's so perfect about it"" Adam replied. ""So, what happened after that?"" David asked, rolling his right hand around, getting ready to start writing again. ""Let's change the topic for a bit. You asked about my poems earlier on. They used to be about life, like I said, nothing in specific, just everything I believed to be true about life. That is, until I met her. Then I started writing about the way she made me feel. And it was great, honestly, probably the best stuff I had ever written. And now...now all my writing is so morbid and full of sorrow, and that's when I even do write. Which is the main reason I decided that it was time to come here, I want to write again"" Adam said, shaking his head. ""This is good, you're opening up"" David said, writing something in his notepad, ""When is the last time you've written something?"" Adam turned to look at him. ""About a month ago, I think"" he replied, before turning back to the window. ""Okay, your first exercise is to write something. It can be a poem, a story, an essay, a paragraph or even a sentence, and it can be about anything, whatever comes to mind, just write it down. What I would also recommend is getting a journal and at the start of each day you could write about everything you'd like to do in the day, like setting some short-term goals to accomplish, and at the end of each day you could write about what you actually did during the day, and if you didn't accomplish any of your goals you could write about what prevented you from doing so, and what you can do to stop this distraction from happening again. Also, your goals should be fairly positive things, you know, like going for a run, or learning something new, or going out to meet new people, just anything positive"" David said, lifting his pen from the notepad. ""Exercise?' Adam asked, sounding confused. ""You didn't think you would just come here, talk about your problems and get better, did you? If so, you were sorely mistaken. When you first made your appointment you said that you hope to leave a little happier, well, the pursuit of happiness is a proactive activity, something that you have to work at"" replied David, adjusting his glasses. ""Hmmm, fair enough..shall we continue?"" Adam asked. ""By all means"" David nodded, getting ready to start writing again. ""I didn't speak to her again until the Friday after we met...I called her early that evening.."" said Adam, closing his eyes and beginning to have another flashback.

He was sitting at the dinner table with his family. On his left, at the head of the table, sat his father, Michael Webber, a lawyer who owned his own firm. On his right was his younger brother, Toby, who was now in grade 10 at the same high school Adam had attended. Sitting directly opposite him was his mother, Lauren, who worked as a writer, Adams biggest role model in life. After having supper Adam went to his bedroom and sat on his bed. He took his phone out and turned it around in his hands for a few minutes, building up the courage to dial her number. He felt his heart rate rise just a little, and his breaths became shorter. He stood up and paced around his room, thinking about the perfect conversation starter. After being unable to come up with anything he sat down on the chair behind his desk and dialed her number. She answered almost immediately, and spoke as if she knew who was calling, ""Hey you"" Adam smiled. ""Um, how did you know who it was?"" he asked. ""I dialed my number from your phone, remember?"" she replied. Adams smile grew bigger. ""What took you so long anyway?"" she asked, filling the silence. ""Uhm, well. I thought I'd keep you waiting a little"" he replied, jokingly. She let out a little laugh, ""Smooth, so what's up?"" she asked. ""Well, are you doing anything tonight? I thought we could go out for ice cream, or something, if you're not busy?"" he asked, now pacing his room again. For a few seconds she didn't say anything and he thought the call might have been cut but then he heard faint voices in the background. ""Okay, I've gotta be home by 10 though"" she said, with excitement in her voice. ""Okay, great! Text me your address and I'll there in about 20, yeah?"" he said, trying hard to hide his excitement. ""Make it 40?"" she replied. ""Yeah okay, see you soon"" he said, hanging up. Toby walked into the room just as his brother did an air punch and started laughing. ""What are you doing?"" he asked. ""I've got a date"" Adam replied, looking slightly embarrassed. ""Nice. Need some pointers, I mean, it is your first one, right?"" Toby asked sarcastically, sitting on the bed. ""Ha ha, very funny. I've been on more dates than you, little bro, and don't ever forget it"" Adam replied winking. He walked to his cupboard and picked out what he was going to wear for the evening: a black ""Man of steel"" t-shirt, a khaki pair of chinos and black sneakers. He decided to take a shower before getting dressed. With a towel wrapped around his waist he walked back into his now-empty bedroom. From his brothers room he could hear the strumming of a guitar and realised what Toby had come to his room for. He put his clothes on and styled his hair with some hair gel. He left his room to find his father. ""Dad, can I go out with my friend?"" he asked, walking up to his father. ""Looks like you've already answered that question"" replied his father, noticing his change of clothes and hairstyle. ""Sorry, I was just so excited I forgot to ask you...I met this girl and.."" he was cut off before he could finish his sentence. ""Take my card, it's on me tonight"" his father said, taking out his wallet from his pocket. ""Wow! Really? Thanks"" Adam replied, reaching out for the card. ""Yeah, she must be really special if you already showered before asking for my permission...also, once upon a time, I went up to my dad saying 'I met this girl' and today she's my wife"" said his father, winking and patting him on the shoulder before walking away. When he was sure 40 minutes had passed he sent Ivy a message saying ""On my way"", greeted his mom and left. He got to Ivys' house fifteen minutes later, finding it without any problems. She was sitting outside on a swing on the veranda next to a man who appeared to be her father. They were laughing about something. Adam walked up to the house and they stood up, as soon as he saw Ivy in the light he stopped walking and stared at her for a few seconds. She was wearing the same dress she had on the day they met, but she had on sandals instead of sneakers, and  her hair was tied in a bow. She caught his eye and let out a shy smile. ""He zones out sometimes"" she said to her father. After a few seconds he walked up to her father and held out his hand. ""Good evening sir, I'm Adam"" he said. ""So you're the photographer? I've gotta tell you, that was smooth. I'm Ivys' father, William. Nice to meet you"" he said, shaking Adams hand and laughing a little. Adams eyes went wide and he was left speechless. ""All ready to go, superman?"" she asked, tapping his shoulder and breaking the silence. ""It's nice to meet you too, sir. We'll be back by 10"" Adam said, before turning to Ivy with his arm held out. She kissed her father on the cheek and took Adams arm. ""I'm more of a Batman type of girl, you know"" she said as they walked towards the car. ""Next time I'll pick you up in my Bat-mobile then"" he replied. He opened the door for her and she giggled, ""Such a gentleman"" Adam closed the door and walked around to the other side of the car. ""You sound surprised"" he replied, while opening the door. ""Little bit..."" she said, as he got into the car. ""I didn't zone out back there, you know, I was just thinking about how beautiful you look"" he said, closing the door. She blushed, ""Thank you...so where are we going?"" she asked. ""You'll see"" he replied. ""I love this ice cream shop!"" she exclaimed as they pulled into the parking lot of ""The Hitchhikers pit stop"". ""I used to come here all the time when I was a kid"" Adam replied. They got a table on the balcony of the two-story building and sat opposite each other. Ivy ordered the ""Friday night chocolate and mint milkshake"" while Adam ordered a normal chocolate milkshake. ""No way! You come to the best ice cream/milkshake shop in town and you order something plain"" Ivy rolled her eyes as their waiter walked away. ""Hey , chocolate milkshakes are my favourite okay"" replied Adam, smiling. ""Do you always stick to stuff you know?"" she asked, leaning forward. ""Always"" Adam replied, leaning forward as well. ""Not tonight. We're swapping"" Ivy said, winking. Adam started laughing. ""I see what's going on here. I see right through you"" Adam replied. ""Oh really? Enlighten me?"" Ivy replied, sounding intrigued. ""You've realised what a horrible mistake you made in not ordering a chocolate milkshake and now you want mine"" Adam replied in a sarcastic tone, raising his eyebrows. Ivy laughed for a few seconds and Adam sat watching her, stunned at how beautiful she was in that moment. ""Okay, you caught me, smart guy. Either way, we're swapping!"" she replied. When the milkshakes came Ivy took the chocolate and mint and slid it over to Adams side of the table. ""Welcome to the wild side"" she said, smiling. ""If I don't like it, we're swapping again"" he returned the smile. ""So...tell me about yourself, stranger"" she said, taking a sip of her milkshake. ""Do you always let strangers buy you milkshake?"" he asked. ""Pretty much. Who else is going to?"" she replied, jokingly. ""Well, what would you like to know?"" he took a sip of the milkshake and his eyes went wide. He took another sip, realising that he actually liked it. ""You like it! I knew you would!"" Ivy started smiling. ""Fine, I'll admit, it's pretty decent"" he replied, taking another sip. ""Decent?! It's the best thing since, well, it's just the best thing! But anyway, what are you studying and why?"" she took a sip of her milkshake. ""I'm studying a BA degree with hopes of becoming a journalist, or a travel writer, and I guess the reason is that I love writing and travelling, and I believe that that's all that matters, you know, doing what you love"" he replied, ""What about you?"" she took another sip, ""I'm doing a BSc degree with the hopes of becoming something one day...I don't really know what I want to do...I like psychology though, which is one of my majors so that's cool...So when can I read some of your poems"" she asks. ""Sorry, I don't let strangers read my poems"" he replied, grinning. ""Do you always buy strangers milkshakes?"" she asked. ""Pretty much"" he winked, ""But, I'll put one or two on my phone and show you on Monday?"" he replied, taking a sip of his milkshake. ""Who said I want to see you again on Monday?"" she replied sarcastically. ""Ahh, and I thought I was being so smooth again, damn"" he rested his chin on his hand and looked at her, smiling. She reached out for his other hand, ""It would be a great privilege to see you again on Monday...and every other day"" she squeezed his hand and let go. ""Damn, and I just wanted Monday"" he replied. ""Well, you've gotta take what you get"" she said. ""So...how come I only met your dad tonight?"" he asked. ""Well, my mom passed away when I was five"" she replied, looking down. ""Oh, I'm so sorry"" he said, reaching for hand and holding it for a few seconds before letting it go again. ""It's okay, I was very young. I feel really bad for my dad though...you know, he loved her very much, still does...I want to experience that before I die, to love completely and unconditionally and be loved back completely and unconditionally, I think it's the most beautiful thing"" she said, looking up again with her eyes wide and filled with passion as she spoke. ""You know. I think most people want that, but not many people know what love actually is"" he said. ""What is love to you?"" she leaned forward in her seat. He leaned forward and his eyes caught hers. Locked in eye contact he began to speak. ""Love is a constant, it's not something that's there one day and gone the next; it's something you always feel. It's not something that's based solely on physical attractions or non-physical connections, but rather on how those two come together, because once you love someone for who they are, they're the most physically attractive person you'll ever meet. Love is also unconditional, you know. It doesn't depend on anything, because once you feel it, you feel it and there's no going back"" he said. She started smiling, ""That was so beautiful"" , he laughed a little. ""That's just what I believe though"" he said, leaning back in his seat. ""Wow! Let me ask you something, have you ever written anyone a poem?"" she asked. ""No, I've never had anyone to write about...tell you what, I'll write a poem for you one day"" he said. ""Keep talking like that and I may just fall for you"" she smiled. Adam laughed. ""Are we going to pretend you haven't already?"" he asked, smiling. Ivy blushed and looked down. She looked up suddenly with wide eyes realising what time it was. ""We should go"" she said. When they got to her house Adam took a seat on the swing on the veranda while Ivy went to tell her father she was home. She came out sat next to Adam, leaving some space between them. ""So, you think I've fallen for you?"" she asked turning to look at him. He moved closer to her, leaving no space between them. He turned to face her, resting his left leg on the swing. ""Not only that"" he said, resting his hand on her back, ""I think I've fallen for you too"" He leaned forward, bringing his face closer to hers. Their eyes met. He stayed there for a while, then leaned in further, leaving no space between them, and their lips met. He closed his eyes.

When he opened them the sight that met him wasn't Ivys eyes, but instead the pond outside Dr Hills office. ""They say that it all goes downhill after the first kiss, but not for us, doc. After that night, everything changed, for the better"" he said, rubbing his eyes. ""How so?"" David asked looking over at Adam. ""We started meeting up at university, at first only during lunch time but after a while whenever we had free time we spent it together, and still it wasn't enough. She met my friends and I met hers, but most of the time we just wanted to be alone. We spent weekends together, not always doing something in particular, just being together was enough. I watched her favourite movies and shows and she watched mine. I got to know her, deep down to the very core of who she was, and in return I opened up myself to her. She studied me and I studied her"" he said. ""When did things start going wrong?"" David asked, shifting a little in his seat. ""We'll get there. Let me tell you about the first time I wrote her a poem. We had decided to go to the park a few blocks away from her house..."" he started having a flashback to that day.

They were walking towards the park in their town, her fingers intertwined in his, as though their hands were designed to fit each others perfectly. They weren't saying much, but that was the beauty of their relationship; the silence was comfortable. They sat on one of the benches at the park, which was empty except for some kids playing on the jungle gym and a few people walking through it. Adam turned to face Ivy. ""So, do you remember on our first date I told you I'd write you a poem one day?"" he asked. Her face seemed to light up. ""Do you have it?"" she asked smiling. Adam nodded and reached into his pocket, pulling out a folded page. ""I was thinking I could read it to you?"" he asked. Ivy nodded excitedly. Adam got up and stood in front of Ivy, looking down at her. His eyes meet hers.
""I look at you and you look at me,
 and suddenly I have so much to say.
 about your smile,
 and how I find it so pleasant,
 like a warm summer day,
 about your eyes,
 and how, for me, they shine much brighter than
 the galaxies I tend to lose myself in,
 about your hair,
 and the way it curls into your ""Mufasa look"",
 I look at you and you look at me,
 and suddenly I know why they say
 'The best things in life are free'"" he spoke slowly, holding the page in front of him, looking down at it a few times. Ivy lifted her hands to cover her mouth, because she had started smiling and blushing. ""What?"" Adam asked, folding the page again. ""It was perfect"" she replied, standing to hug him. They held each other for a while, his arms around her waist, her arms wrapped around his back. Her head resting in the curve of his neck. They sat on the bench again and she rested her head on his shoulder, he put his arm around her.

""...And we just sat there for a while, until the sun set"" he turned to look at David who was making some notes. ""Right, I see. Not a bad poem, just by the way"" said David. ""Thank you, doc"" replied Adam smiling and turning to face the window again. ""So, are you ready to tell me when things started going awry?"" David asked. ""Yeah, we're at that part of the story"" Adam sank into his seat a little. ""Before I start telling you about that, you should know that Ivy and I were almost completely different, in terms of our interests, our likes and dislikes, our beliefs about certain things and even what we were studying, but we fit together so well. There was absolutely no friction, and I've come to learn that when people say stuff like ""relationships require a little friction"" or ""you shouldn't worry when you fight, you should worry when you don't fight because it means that you don't care enough to fight"" they aren't always right, because Ivy and I never had anything to argue or fight about. We didn't always agree, sure, but we were both so compromising that there was no need for a fight. I let her do her thing, and she let me do mine, and eventually there was no 'her thing' or 'my thing', it was just 'our thing'. Which makes the night she told me she was leaving the first time we ever had friction. It also happens to be the first time I told her I love her"" Adam said, his head hanging low, staring for the first time at the ground and not at the window. ""So, what happened?"" David asked. ""Well, it was early evening and we had decided to walk to this cafe not too far from my house. We stayed for a while, and everything seemed normal. Then we left at about 8 or 9, when it was dark. She asked me if we could talk for a while on this bench we passed, and I agreed without thinking twice because I had just written her another poem and couldn't wait to recite it to her..."" Adam closed his eyes and began to have a flashback of that night.

They had just sat down on the bench and Ivy was staring at the sky, Adam was staring at her. ""Guess what"" he said, standing up. ""What?"" she asked, shifting her gaze from the bright moon to Adam, who now stood in front of her. ""I wrote you another poem"" he said excitedly. ""Adam..."" she began to say before he cut her off, starting to recite his poem.
""I wanted to write you a poem,
 to tell you how much I
 enjoy your company,
 to tell you how much I
 hate it when we're apart,
 to tell you how much I
 like our conversations,
 to tell you how much I
 adore our comfortable silences,
 to tell you how much I
 appreciate every second I ever got to hold your hand,
 to tell you how much I
 wish I could kiss your soft lips more often,
 the truth is,
 I wanted to write you a poem
 just to tell you how much I love you"" by the time he had finished the poem Ivy had tears rolling down her cheeks. Adam sat next to her and put his arm around her, pulling her closer. She rested her head on his shoulder and he held her for a while. Then she lifted her head and turned to face him. ""I'm leaving"" she said, sniffing. ""What? Leaving?"" Adam asked, looking confused. ""Earlier on in the year I applied for a scholarship to study overseas next year and I got accepted...I didn't tell you because I didn't think I would, their requirements were ridiculous and..."" Adam cut her off, his eyes were wide. ""That's great, Ivy! Wow, I'm really proud of you"" he spoke excitedly, taking her hands in his. ""Adam, aren't you upset?"" she asked. ""I suppose, but I know it's always been a dream of yours and I wouldn't dare beguile you of it!"" he replied. ""I have a few days to accept or reject it..you know, if you asked me to stay I..."" she let go of Adams hands to wipe her face. ""Ask you to stay? Ivy, I could never"" Adam stood and after a while Ivy did too. They began walking towards Adams house, not saying anything, and Ivy slid her fingers into his when Adam realised something; she hadn't said it back and then, even though they were holding hands, Adam felt, for the first time, like they couldn't have been farther apart. It was also the first time their silence felt uncomfortable. He dropped her off at home and everything changed. She decided to accept the offer the next day and it was set; she was to fly to England on the 20th of December. They stopped seeing each other as often, their conversations became shorter and forced and, which Adam found most upsetting, their silence remained uncomfortable. The night before she left, Ivy drove to Adam's house. She said goodbye to his brother and parents and they went outside. ""Adam...we need to talk"" she said, stopping by the door of her fathers car. She began speaking slowly, her voice shaking a little. ""On the night of our first date, I told you that before I die I want to love someone completely and unconditionally and be loved, by that person, in return, and you have given me that. These past few months have probably been the best of my life. The night you told me you love me, I didn't say it back, not because I don't, but because I knew what was coming. I knew that if I told you I love you right before I told you I'm leaving it wouldn't have had the effect on you that I would have wanted to. Now, things have changed, but I know that our feelings have stayed the same. However, I think that maybe we should..."" Ivy stopped speaking and looked down. Adam stepped closer to her and lifted her face, until her eyes met his. ""Ivy, you should know something, about the night of our first date, when I was walking towards you and your father and I froze; That night when I saw you, I fell in love. And I think you smiled because you knew...so please don't say what I think it is you're about to say. Things have changed, and will continue to change, but we can get through it, together"" he said. ""We should...we should break up, Adam. I wish that what we had could last forever, but everything comes to an end"" she turned her face away. ""Fine then. If that's what you want"" he said, stepping back. She stepped forward and kissed him lightly on the cheek. He looked down, accepting defeat. ""I just want you to know, I do love you. More than you'll probably ever know...I hope we meet again some day, when we could last. Because our love deserves nothing less than forever"" she said, before climbing into her father's car and driving away. He looked up and suddenly she was gone. He stood in the road outside his house, left alone with the moon and stars, which shone above ever so brightly as though a dark cloud hadn't just settled over his entire world. He closed his eyes, fighting back tears.

When he opened he eyes he could feel the tears he had tried so hard to fight back rolling down his cheeks and wiped them away. ""Sorry, doc. I tend to be a bit sensitive around this topic"" he sniffs. ""It's alright. This is your space"" David replied. ""You know what hurts the most? The fact that she didn't even say goodbye. She just got in the damn car and drove away, and that was it. No text, no email, no phone call, no nothing. I don't know how one can just wake up one day and decide that they're going to cut someone out of their life, I just don't get it, doc. At the end of the day, I have learnt one thing though "" Adam said, looking over at Dr Hill. ""What's that?"" David asked. ""I've learnt to appreciate each and every moment in its entirety, whether it's good or bad, because the truth is that nothing ever happens exactly the same way twice, and often we find ourselves wishing to relive certain moments which, at the time, we didn't fully appreciate"" Adam replied, still looking at Dr Hill. ""You know, Adam, there are no wise words that I, nor anyone else for that matter, can say to stop the pain. In fact, that is something that only you can do, and by you coming here you've taken the first step. There is this saying that I like, and I'd like to share it with you: 'One day, whether you are 14, 28 or 65  you will stumble upon someone who will start a fire in you that cannot die. However, the saddest, most awful truth you will ever come to find is that they are not always with whom we spend our lives' and you should know that though this may be true, it does not mean that all hope is lost, because life goes on, you know. We meet new people, we make new memories. We can learn to love again, and that, I believe, is the beauty of life""
"
11,"Jack stood in front of his mirror, as he did every morning before he left the house to make sure he looked presentable. He thought it was especially important to perform the routine this morning because he was going to work and not school. He stared at his reflection for a few seconds. He already had a black jeans and his black all stars on but no shirt. He always styled his hair before putting a shirt on, so that he could avoid getting water or gel on it. Once he was satisfied with his comb over, he put on the shirt. It was plain white, customary of iStore employees, and long-sleeved. Even though it was summer he had requested long-sleeved shirts only, and he didn't intend on rolling up the sleeves. All his shirts and t-shirts are long sleeved, so that he could hide his mark. Most people are comfortable showing their marks to the world, wearing it like hearts on their sleeves, but he felt that his mark wasn't anyone else’s business. The only other people to have seen his mark are his parents, his friends from primary school and the doctor who delivered him, and he planned to keep it that way until he met her.
The reason he didn't hide it in primary school was that he didn't know any better and he wasn't concerned because in those days no one really paid attention to it. He rolled up his right sleeve just up passed his forearm so that he could glance at it. It had a very odd shape, like a circle with one end pulled outward. He heard stories of the strangest marks; some, when completed, even formed the shape of animals. He rolled his sleeve down and left the room, making his way toward the kitchen where his parents, and breakfast, were waiting. ""Nervous?"" asks his mother, Susan, putting an arm on his shoulder. Susan Graham worked as a librarian in their town. Since it was so close to their house she walked there and back every day, claiming that the exercise was good for her. She worked at the library in her school days and enjoyed it so much that she decided to stay.
She met Jacks father, Steve, while working. She joked that she knew he was the one instantly, for two reasons. The first being that his mark completed hers and the second being that he was checking out the entire Harry Potter series. Together, their marks made a circle. A circle is said to have many symbolic meanings, from strength to psyche. In the context of love, however, it symbolises connectedness, wholeness and unity. Jack always enjoyed hearing the stories of how couples met because, even though it's inevitable, the universe seemed to always have interesting ways of bringing people together. By most standards Jack could be considered to be somewhat of a hopeless romantic, desiring desperately to meet the one. ""Not at all"" he replies, smiling. ""That's my boy"" says his father, nodding approvingly. ""Come on, eat something. We leave in fifteen minutes."" says Steve.
 Jack isn't a big eater and is full after one sunny side up egg on a slice of toast with a cup of coffee. Since the mall wasn't very far from their house, and these days there's hardly ever traffic, they got there in just under twenty minutes. Steve studied pharmacy through UNISA and, instead of opening his own pharmacy, decided to take up a position at Dischem. Dischem was close to the entrance of the mall so Steve didn't have a very long way to walk. ""See you at lunch?"" he turns around and shouts out to Jack. ""Yea, sure, I'll call you"" Jack replies over his shoulder. He lifts his left arm to look at the time on his watch, 7:45am. He has been to the mall hundreds of times but never this early and has never seen it this empty. He makes his way to the iStore. When he gets there it is 7:50 am and the doors are still closed. The other employees stand outside and wait for the guy with the keys, who is obviously late. Jack sees two familiar faces, two people he met during training; Natalie and Fred. He makes his way towards them and as soon as Natalie sees him she smiles and waves.
She is shorter than him, her skin is light, her hair is reddish and her eyes a light brown and she had a sort of comforting smile. Only a blind man, or a fool, would deny that Natalie was very beautiful but since her mark wasn't the one to complete his, Jack tried his best to ignore her beauty. Next to her stood Fred, towering over her. Because of his muscular build and giant-height he looked menacing, but only from the neck down. Fred had the kindest-looking face that Jack had ever seen. His skin was light brown, his eyes a grassy green, his hair dark and his face seemed baby-like with no facial hair or pimples. His personality was a mixture between menacing, like his body, and kind, like his face. Jack scratched at his chin, where his recently-shaved beard was growing back.
""Hey guys. Ready?"" he asks, smiling. ""Yes, of course. After all that training this should be nothing"" replies Fred. Natalie yawns and Jack notices the dark circles under her eyes. Her words aren't very clear but Jack hears them, ""I just can't wait to get home"" she rubs her eyes. ""No need to be so happy about it, Nats"" Jack says sarcastically, pulling her in for a hug. ""Well, you promised to be the optimistic one. Considering why you even applied for this job"" she says into his chest and he smiles. He remembers the second day of training, during their lunch break they spoke about why they applied for the position. Natalie’s only reason was money, Fred gave two reasons; money and he just simply loved ""i products"". Jack gave three. The first being money, the second being that he knew most of his two-month holiday would just be spent moping around at home (since he didn't have a very social life) and the third was that he thought getting a job would increase his chances of meeting the one this holiday. Logically he knew that he was wrong because his mother told him that it is not something we can control, that the universe (or God, as some people said) already had a specific plan for all of us and that we would meet them when the time was right.
 He remembered the time he first found out about the marks. People didn't always have them. In the year 2020, his mother had said, the Earth had become severely overpopulated. The population count had reached 8 billion, and was still rising. Poverty, global warming, food shortages and water shortages were beginning to affect everyone, including the rich. Oil had also become very rare. His mother said the main reason for overpopulation was that everyone was getting intimate with everyone. It was quite possible for one woman to have five children, all from different men. It became so bad that thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands, of people were dying every day from hunger or diseases. Everyone knew that if this went on for much longer the human race would become extinct. Before the humans could do anything, however, nature began to take action; the Earth began to protect itself.
Over time, doctors got increasing reports of women being able to have only one child. At first they thought that it was just another disease but then they realised exactly what it was: the next step in human evolution. The evolution did not stop there, however. Nobody realised it at the time but these marks were part of the phase in human evolution. One day a man, no one remembers who he was, told the story of he met his wife. He claimed that for years he was drawn to a woman he had never met; this included having frequent dreams about her. He claimed that, though he didn't know if she even existed or not, he was attracted to no one but her. Then one day he met her, Juliet, and found that her mark complemented his. Together, the shape it made was a heart. And that is when everything changed. Suddenly every baby was being born with strange marks on their right arms, which was only half of a whole. Now, 200 years later, in the year 2220 Jack Graham begins his first day at work, anxious to meet his Juliet. The guy with the keys finally showed up, luckily before the manager. Jack checked his watch, 8:00 am.
The first two hours went by slowly because they had no customers. Everyone was just standing and talking. Then a man and a woman walked in, holding hands. Jack was closest to the door so he ended up helping them. They asked about the latest iPhone and Jack was able to tell them everything about it, because he had one. ""It really is a great phone, you can't go wrong with it"" he said finally. ""Great. You're really good. We'll take two. One white, one black"" said the man, smiling. Jack sent Fred to the back to get the phones while he tended to the couple. At 12 Jack, Fred, Natalie and the other new employees had their lunch break, till 1. Jack called his father and the four of them went to the food court. They sat down and started talking. ""So, how's day one going?"" asks Steve, looking across the table from Natalie to Fred, glad that his son had made friends. ""Really slow, actually. But at least Jack made a sale"" replies Natalie, yawing again.
The circles around her eyes had become darker in the four hours they'd been working. ""Well I'm glad we got to talk so much"" says Fred, putting a chip in his mouth. ""What did you talk about?"" asks Steve, looking at Jack. ""Plato’s Symposium. What else?"" replies Jack. ""Oh yes"" Steve says, smiling. Jack remembers the first time he read the text and the passage that stood out the most to him: According to Greek mythology, humans were originally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves. Though he didn't believe in Greek mythology, he liked the idea. More so because he knew that, thanks to the marks, it was now sort of true. At 12:45pm they all made their way back. Steve to Dischem and the others to the iStore. ""All I'm saying is that, with my luck, he was probably run over by a bus"" Natalie snaps. Fred and Jack can't help but laugh. The rest of the day was just as quiet as the morning. Steve let Jack drive them home; once again there was no traffic. ""In my opinion that's the best part about having only 4 billion people on the planet"" says Steve, ""Imagine all the traffic they had when there were 8 billion people!"" Jack shuddered at the thought he had, 4 billion had to die. He found it hard to believe that they died naturally but there was no evidence to suggest anything else. When they reach the house Susan is sitting outside in the sun, reading a book.
 As they pull into the driveway she stands, smiling. ""How was it?"" she asks, looking at Jack. Jack sighs, ""Long, terribly long. But I made a sale"" Susan smiles and kisses Steve on the cheek, ""And how was your day?"" He puts an arm around her shoulder and they walk into the house, ""It just got a whole lot better"" Jack watched them enviously. He tried to remain hopeful that he would meet her but as the days went by he began to lose hope, slowly but surely until the last week of his contract when he finally decided that he would just wait until ""the right"" time, whenever that may be. He looked back on the past two months and realised that, even though she hadn't stumbled into the iStore, he didn't regret it one bit. He had become close friends with Natalie and Fred and they planned to keep it that way once the contract was over. The Monday of the last week he didn't go home at 5 with his father, he had other plans. He met an attractive girl that day and they clicked and decided to get milkshakes or ice cream later that day. He took out his iPhone and was about to dial her number when he saw her, walking towards him. She was slightly shorter than him, her long dark hair flowed over her olive skin, her deep blue eyes seemed to look not at him but rather at his soul, at the very core of who he was, he liked that.

Then she smiled, and that's what he liked most about her. She had the kind of smile that could brighten up anyone’s day, no matter how bad it was, the kind of smile which seemed to say a thousand words without actually saying any. She was wearing the same dress she had on when he saw her earlier. It was a casual floral dress and she looked good in it but the part he liked most about her outfit was that she wore sneakers with it. He hadn't seen her mark earlier because she had covered it up with make-up. As she came closer he saw that the makeup was still on. ""Hey, Adriana"" he called out, smiling. She returned the smile. That smile he thought silently to himself. They went to one of the ice cream shops and sat down. He checked his watch, 5:30 pm. They decided on milkshakes, he had chocolate and she had strawberry. They just sat and talked and drank their milkshakes. She told him about growing up in Italy and why they moved to South Africa. She said that her father was offered a position in South Africa and he didn't think twice about accepting and when they left she was 15. She still had her Italian accent and Jack loved it, every word she spoke was like melody to his ears.
When she stopped talking an awkward silence filled the air. They both looked down at their milkshakes then Jack suddenly had an idea and looked up, smiling. ""Hey, have you ever played 21 questions?"" he asked, drinking some milkshake through a straw. Suddenly he had a striking pain in his head and he closed his eyes tightly, shaking his head. Brain freeze. Once the pain had stopped they both started laughing. ""No I haven't. What is it?"" she asked, her laugh turned into a smile and her eyes met his. Neither of them said anything for a few seconds, getting lost in each other’s eyes. Then Jack came out of his daze, ""Ok, the way it works is, I ask you a question and you answer it and then ask me a question and then I answer and that just goes on. It's supposed to be a fun way of getting to know someone"" he says, his eyes still locked on hers. ""Ok, sounds interesting. You go first"" she replies, not daring to blink. ""Hmm, ok. What is your favourite colour?"" he asks, looking down then catching her eyes again. Those eyes. ""Well, lime. What's yours?"" she replies. ""You're not allowed to ask my question, but I'll allow it this once, because I'm so sweet"" he laughs. She laughs too. ""Well, it used to be white, but now I'm thinking the shade of blue that your eyes have"" he says, smiling and winking.
 She blushes and looks down. ""Ok my turn. What school did you go to?"" he asks. ""Parktown girls. Ok I have a serious one. If you knew today was your last day on Earth, how would you spend it and why?"" she asked, finally breaking the eye contact, but still smiling. ""Hmmm, good question. Let's see..."" he says, holding his neck looking out into the distance, staring at nothing for a few seconds before catching her eyes again and saying ""I'd tell everyone I care about how much I love them, just so that I know that they know, and then I guess I'd just spend the day doing all my favourite things and invite you along"" he smiles. ""How come you cover yours?"" he asks, looking at her right arm on the table, which seemed to have no mark. ""Uhm, well I guess I just feel like it's private, you know. Not something I want to share with the world. I know I'm not allowed to ask the same question but why do you cover yours?"" she asks, putting her right hand on his right forearm, where his mark is. He puts his left hand over her right hand. ""The same reason you gave. It's private. And also, when I do eventually meet her I want her to fall for me, and not for the mark, you know? Probably sounds crazy"" he replies, looking down at their hands.

She lifts his head with her free hand and smiles, ""Doesn't sound crazy at all. I completely understand. And I think that you'll have no trouble making her fall for you"" she says, smiling and winking. They continue their game of 21 questions for a while and then he looks at his watch, 10 pm. ""Guess what"" he says, putting his hand in his pocket to take out his wallet and smiling. ""What?"" she asks. 'We've been talking for five hours"" he says, calling the waiter. They both start laughing. After he pays they make their way to his father’s car. After he made plans with Adriana he called his father to ask if he could use the car. ""Yea sure, I'll tell your mom to get me. You have enough money?"" was all his father had said. Adriana stayed 10 minutes away from the mall, almost within walking distance. Jack parked the car next to the pavement and got out to walk Adriana to her front door.
""Thank you f..."" she starts to say but is stopped when Jack kisses her, she kisses him back. She puts he arms around his neck and he puts his hands around her waist to keep her close. They stay like that for a while, and then Jack pulls away. ""Call me"" she says. ""I will"" he replies, kissing her on her cheek and walking back to the car. When he gets home his parents are waiting up for him. ""How was it?"" his mother asks as soon as he walks through the front door. ""It was great. She's amazing"" he replies, smiling. ""Is she the one you've been looking for?"" his mother asks, smiling. ""I think so"" he replies. ""So her mark complemented yours?"" his father asks. Jack shakes his head, ""We didn't show each other our marks"" he looks down at his right arm. Susan and Steve exchange wary looks but don't say anything. ""Well if you're hungry there's food in the kitchen"" says Susan, breaking the silence. ""No it's ok, I'm going to shower and then sleep. Good night, see you in the morning"" he says, walking out of the room.
 He stares up at his bedroom ceiling, unable to fall asleep. His mind runs and he struggles to catch it. What if her mark is different? He asks himself silently and battles with the idea for what seems hours before finally coming to a conclusion. It doesn't matter, it won't matter he assures himself before falling asleep. He wakes to the sound of his alarm and grabs it to shut it off when he sees a message, from Adriana. He sits up suddenly, staring at his phone, and forgets all about the sound of the alarm. Good morning, hope you have a great day. Call me later? She wrote, with a smiley face. For the first time in two months he gets out of bed with a smile, showers and performs his daily morning routine. After breakfast him and his father head to the mall. When he gets to the iStore he finds Natalie and Fred. ""And? How did it go with that chick?"" Fred asks. ""Ahh man, it was great. We just sat and talked for a few hours"" he replies smiling. He seemed to be glowing, something which, in all the time Natalie and Fred have known him, has never happened. ""Did you see her mark? Is she the one?"" Natalie asks, almost too excitedly.
 Jack didn't blame her, for two months almost all he talked about was meeting her. ""We didn't show each other our marks, but I've decided that it doesn't really matter"" he replies, not quite sure what he means by that. Of course it mattered; it mattered more than anything in the world. Natalie’s eyes go wide. ""You've fallen for her, haven't you?"" she asks. Jack smiles and looks down at his feet. ""You do know that if it isn't the same...” says Fred, but Natalie stops him from finishing his sentence.”Screw that. If he likes her then that's irrelevant"" she snaps. But is it? He asks himself. ""We'll talk about it at lunch"" he says as the doors open. Four hours later the three of them make their way to the food court and sit down. ""Where's your dad today?"" Natalie asks, looking around. ""I think he has a meeting or something"" Jack replies, shrugging, ""What did you mean earlier? When you said it doesn't matter?"" he leans forward. ""I meant that if you really like then that's all that matters, not some mark on your arm"" she replies.
""But Nats...” Fred starts speaking before Natalie snaps at him, ""What, Fred?! Should he just ignore how he feels and walk away?"" Fred sinks into his chair. ""Look. You spent two months waiting to meet some mystery girl you could fall in love with and now you have, don't let that mark on your arm change anything. That's all I mean"" she says, folding her arms. Jack has never heard anyone speak about the mark this way, as if it was irrelevant. When they get back to the iStore after lunch he doesn't say much and a silence fills the air in the car on the way home. What Natalie said really got to him and he didn't even know who he could talk to about it. ""What's troubling you?"" his father asks eventually. Jack sighs. ""Ok but whatever we talk about has to stay between us, you can't even tell mom. Deal?"" he says, looking at his father who nods silently. ""Ok. I've just been thinking. I really like that girl, Adriana, but what if her mark is different? What will I do then?"" he takes a deep breath in and then exhales.
 ""Well. You're still really young. I know that most people meet the one at around your age but you still have your whole life to meet her. And if this thing with Adriana gets serious the choice will always be yours. When I met your mother I didn't know she was the one because of our marks, I knew because of how she made me feel, no other girl before her made me feel that way, and no other woman after has. That's how you know"" his father replies, reassuringly. Jack let out a smile; he suddenly knew what he had to do. When he gets home he says hi to his mom and goes to his room to call Adriana. She answers and he swallows hard. ""Hey"" he says casually. They make small talk for a while, asking how the others day went, before he gets to the reason he called. ""So I was thinking, do you want to come over Saturday night? If you don't already have plans. I remember you said that you like lying on the grass and watching the stars, alone, but I was thinking that maybe we could do it together"" he says, his heart pounding against his chest.
""One thing I like more than being alone is being alone with the right person"" she replies. He takes a deep breath in and then lets it out ""Awesome. I'll pick you up at 7, then?"" he stands up. ""I'll be waiting. My mom’s calling me for supper, I'll message you when I'm done"" she says. ""I'll be waiting"" he repeats. She chuckles then hangs up. The rest of the week is slow. Schools had opened again and people had returned to work so the mall was almost always empty, and the iStore even emptier. He told Natalie and Fred about his plan, Natalie agreed but Fred barely agreed or disagreed. After what seemed four years, but what was really four days, Saturday came. He wanted everything to be perfect. He made a list of everything he thought he might need: Snacks, drinks, music, pillows and two blankets (One to lie on and one in case it got cold). Everything was set up outside by 5pm. ""A little eager, aren't we?"" Susan asked as she stepped outside.
They both chuckled, ""Just want to make sure I have everything"" he says, looking down at the blanket spread out on the grass; The snacks were in the middle, two pillows were set side-by-side at one end and the other blanket was set on the other end. He wasn't sure exactly what she liked so he just got a bit of everything; some chocolate, some gums, some crisp, some bubblegum. After he's satisfied with everything outside he has a shower, sprays on some perfume and gets dressed. His black all stars, a light blue jeans and a black t shirt under a light blue, long-sleeved, shirt which he left unbuttoned. His hair was set in its usual comb over. He checks his watch, 6pm. He leaves his house at 6:30pm. The sun had almost completely set and the sky was clear, perfect for stargazing. He gets to her house at 6:50pm and walks up to the front door, he knocks three times. Not too hard, not too soft. The door opens and he expects to see Adriana, instead he sees what must be her father.
""You must be Jack"" he says, his Italian accent stronger than his daughters. ""Yes. Jack Graham, nice to meet you"" he replies, smiling and holding out his hand. ""Donatello  Apollo, but you can call me Don. Please come in"" her father replied, shaking Jacks hand. Jack followed Don to the living room where they sat down. ""Adriana will come soon, sorry. You know women"" says Don laughing and shaking his head. Jack smiles, ""It's not a problem"" Don tells Jack about his profession as an industrial psychologist and the company he worked for. He said his wife, Dr Elizabeth Apollo, worked as a clinical psychologist and was a lecturer at WITS University. After about 10 minutes Adriana walked into the room. Jack stared at her, barely even blinking. Her hair was loose and flowed over shoulders; she was wearing a casual white dress and black sneakers. She had a black cardigan in her hand. She smiled at him ""Hey, you"" he smiled back and stood up. ""Hey"" he said, walking towards her. ""So what do you have planned for the night?"" Don asks, standing up. ""We're just going to hang out at my house; I won't bring her back too late"" Jack replies.
Don walks them to the door and hugs his daughter, then kisses her on the forehead. ""Have fun"" he says so softly that it is almost a whisper. He shakes Jacks hand and they leave. ""Your dad is really nice"" he says in the car, looking at her. ""Yea he is, such a sweetheart really"" she replies, retuning his look. ""You look really nice"" he says, smiling. She blushes, ""You're not too bad yourself"" are the only words that come out. When they get to Jacks house he introduces her to Susan and Steve and they go outside. There is a light illuminating the backyard. She looks out at the open yard until she sees the blanket and then smiles. Jack puts the light off and they lay down, facing the night sky. Jack feels her hand next to his but doesn't take it. ""Beautiful night"" she says, slipping her fingers into the spaces between his. He moves his hand a bit, until her hand fits perfectly in his. They lay there for a while, Adriana pointing out all the constellations she could see. ""You really know a lot about this stuff, hey"" Jack says, sounding impressed.
""Yea. In Italy, when I was younger, my dad used to take me stargazing all the time"" she replies. Jack sits up and then lays on his side, facing her. He is left breathless for a few seconds. ""Adriana. I want to share something with you. But I want you to know that, no matter what, it won't change anything"" he says, his eyes locked on hers. She sits up straight and faces him. Then she holds up her right arm. From the corner of his eye he could see her mark was visible but he couldn't make out what it was. Then he sits up straight, too. He starts rolling his right sleeve up and moves his right arm towards hers, slowly, while she moves hers towards his. They don't break eye contact and smile at each other. As soon as their arms touch he leans in and kisses her. She kisses him back. Then they pull away and look down at their joined arms.
Adriana looks up, her blue eyes wide. Jacks expression is blank. Blinking uncontrollably he looks up, then down, then up again.
